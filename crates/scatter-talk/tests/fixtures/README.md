# `scatter-talk` test fixtures

Talk pages from Wikipedia, fetched by `tools/talk_dumps.py` from `https://en.wikipedia.org/w/api.php` and converted by
`tools/talk_fixtures.py`, for the golden tests in `../samples.rs` (ADR 0090 §13).

**The text is by Wikipedia's contributors** and is available under the
[Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)
(older revisions also under the GFDL). The authors of each page are listed in its history,
linked below; the full-history dump also names the author of every revision. The DiscussionTools
responses are the extension's reading of the same revisions. The fixtures are test data: they
are read by the tests at run time and are not compiled into any crate.

**Changes:** the dumps are recompressed with bzip2, and the DiscussionTools responses have their
rendered `html` fields removed. Nothing else is altered.
