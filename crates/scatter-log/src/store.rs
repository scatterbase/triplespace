//! The `LogStore` contract (0005 §4.2; 0013 §1): `append`, `read`, `scan`,
//! `erase_parts`, `compact` and `head`, over partitions of gapless offsets.
//!
//! The store owns the header fields it alone can fill — the partition, the offset and
//! the body commitment — and takes the rest from a [`Draft`]: the time, the payload
//! type, the key and the global IDs, which the appending layer assigns in the same
//! transaction (0015 §2). Offsets are never reused: an erased record keeps its header,
//! and a compacted one leaves a hole that keeps only its Merkle leaf, which `read`
//! reports as [`Slot::Compacted`], so the tree over every offset still folds.
//!
//! The two backends are [`MemoryStore`](crate::memory::MemoryStore) and the
//! [`SegmentStore`](crate::segments::SegmentStore) file backend here, and
//! `scatter-log-postgres`. All of them pass [`conformance`](crate::conformance).
