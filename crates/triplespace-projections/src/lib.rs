//! The `view` projections over Postgres (0013 §5, §7; 0005 §2): the [`PgBackend`] that
//! drives `scatter-projection`'s pipeline on the `ops` tables, and the projections in
//! step order.
//!
//! - Step 1, what the write path reads: [`registry`], [`actors`] (actor, group,
//!   membership, block, acl), the keyed surrogates ([`sources`]), and the tier-1 state of
//!   0083 §4, `graph_state` and `entity_revision` ([`revision_state`]).
//! - Step 2, the source graphs: `entity_source` and `keyed_map` ([`sources`]), `job`
//!   ([`jobs`]).
//! - Step 4, resolution: `entity` with its `term` and `identifier` tables ([`entities`]).
//! - Step 5: `activity` ([`activity`]); the feeds that read it ([`feed`], 0020 §1).
//!
//! Document pages are step 2 ([`pages`]). Clusters (step 3), sitelinks, references, corrections, constraints, patrol,
//! filters, notifications and RDF follow as the crates that produce their records are
//! built. [`milestone_pipeline`] assembles the set built so far.
