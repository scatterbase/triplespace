//! A mirror sync (0002 §8.4; 0012 §2.2; 0006 §2): an instance job over a provider's
//! mirror partition. Each state the adapter hands over is checked against the version
//! cursor — an older revision, or the same content under the same mapping, means
//! `unchanged` — and otherwise written as a
//! `put` carrying `prev_upstream`, `first_seen`, both sizes and the `changes` summary.
//! Upstream snak and reference hashes are recomputed; a differing one is kept and counted
//! (the hash guard). In `snapshot` mode the entities the job did not see are tombstoned
//! once it completes, unless more than the threshold would go.
//!
//! A keyed entity is never tombstoned (0009 §9; architecture 05 §2.2, §4.2): an upstream
//! deletion, or its absence from a snapshot, clears the mirror's contribution with a `put`
//! of the empty state, as it does for every entity of a provider registered
//! `deletion = clear`. A key-mapped sync also keeps the mapping honest: when an upstream
//! item the job saw no longer owns the key it owned before (its identity value changed,
//! or it stopped being mapped), that key is cleared; and when an item becomes mapped, the
//! foreign item it was (`XDQ9`) is tombstoned, since a mapped item's upstream ID never
//! appears as a subject. An upstream redirect is written once; a later sync that sees the
//! same redirect leaves it.
//!
//! A mirror record's revision ID is the upstream revision's (0013 §6), and an upstream
//! revision belongs to one page, so a `put` claims it only the first time it is recorded.
//! A state re-written at a revision already recorded, because the mapping moved rather
//! than the item (an alias added, a key gained or lost, a value pointing at a moved
//! item), carries no `revid`; its `version` is `{revid}+{job version}`.
