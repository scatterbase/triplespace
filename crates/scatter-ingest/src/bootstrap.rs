//! Bootstrap mode (0013 §9; 05 §3.7–3.8): the initial load of an empty mirror partition.
//!
//! An initial load has no previous state to read, so every record it writes is known from
//! the dump alone: a new entity's `put` (prev_upstream, prev_size and delta absent,
//! `first_seen` now, the changes against nothing) as [`crate::sync::run_sync_in`] writes for
//! a subject with no cursor. That is what lets the work be split. [`Prepare::item`] turns
//! one sync item into a draft and its body's commitment, touching no store: the hash check,
//! the operation, its canonical encoding and the part hashes, which a caller runs on worker
//! threads. [`run_bootstrap`] takes the prepared records in dump order and, a block at a
//! time, gives them page IDs from one reservation, appends them with
//! [`IngestStore::append_many`] (binary `COPY` in Postgres) and commits.
//!
//! The projections run during the load, over each block at once
//! ([`scatter_projection::Pipeline::apply_inline_many`]; 0013 A71): set-based where a
//! projection has a form for it, record by record otherwise, so the record table keeps its
//! key index for that path. A load runs in units of `batch`
//! records, each committed: a load that fails part way leaves a partition without holes,
//! which a rerun (no longer empty) continues through the ordinary sync, whose version
//! cursor skips what is already there. The coordinator table of 05 §3.8, for writers in
//! several processes resuming a block, is not needed by one in-process coordinator and is
//! not built.
//!
//! A block's commit does not wait for the disk ([`IngestStore::commit_waits_for_disk`];
//! 0013 A72): a crash loses at most the last blocks committed, which the rerun loads
//! again; the last unit, which finishes the job, waits, and so makes the whole load
//! durable once it returns.
//!
//! The tables a load writes grow from nothing faster than the database's own statistics
//! follow, so the load refreshes them ([`IngestStore::refresh_statistics`]) each time the
//! number of blocks written doubles (0013 A73): a plan chosen for an empty table scans every row
//! written so far on every block, which makes a load quadratic.
//!
//! A [`Prepare`] may be given the projections' per-record work ([`Warm`]; 0013 A74), which
//! then runs on the threads that prepare the records, ahead of the coordinator, so that
//! applying a block is little more than its statements.
//!
//! Only an instance mirror whose subjects are their own keys is bootstrapped: a keyed
//! subject's surrogate is minted on the write path (0009 §7), so a key-mapped provider
//! loads through the ordinary sync.
