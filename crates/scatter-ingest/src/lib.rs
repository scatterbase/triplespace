//! Ingest (0002 §8; 0011 §6.3; 0035): the write path that turns operations into records,
//! and the jobs that run it in bulk.
//!
//! - [`mod@write`]: one operation becomes one record in the right partition, with its IDs
//!   taken from the tenant's sequences, its key (an entity ID or a keyed entity's
//!   surrogate), its attestation, and the base-offset check of 0006 §8; then the
//!   synchronous projections run on it in the same unit of work (0013 §7).
//! - [`job`]: a job's records in the log — `start`, `finish`, `fail` — and its counts.
//! - [`batch`]: a local bulk job over an NDJSON batch: temporary handles, match keys,
//!   `create-or-add` resolution, bulk `retain`, atomic or streamed, with rejects.
//! - [`sync`]: a mirror sync in `upsert` or `snapshot` mode: the version cursor, the hash
//!   guard of 0006 §2, `prev_upstream`, `first_seen`, sizes and the `changes` summary of
//!   0012 §2.2, and the tombstone sweep with its threshold.
//! - [`adopt`]: the adoption job of 0035: preconditions, sequence floors, idempotent
//!   resume, adopted accounts.
//!
//! Everything runs against an [`IngestStore`], the projection backend extended with
//! appending, sequences and the lookups a job needs; [`memory::MemoryIngest`] is the
//! in-memory one. The crate knows no database (0005 §2).
