Scripts that are not part of the build. The Python ones need only the standard library unless
they say otherwise; every script prints its own usage with `--help`.

| Script | What it does |
|---|---|
| `wikidata-sample.py` | Draws a uniformly random sample of Wikidata items from a JSON dump, in the dump's shape, for the classifier audit (0003 §10). |
| `dump_slice.py` | Cuts a smaller, valid MediaWiki XML dump out of a Wikibase dump: the first N entities (`--limit`), or a reproducible random sample of items (`--sample N --seed S`), with `--all-properties` to carry every property page so each snak keeps its datatype, `--include Q1,P5` to force entities in, and `--defined-only` to drop items that use a property the slice lacks. Streams the input; `.gz` or plain `.xml` either side. The Librarybase sample fixture (below) is made with it. |
| `librarybase_parse.py` | Downloads a wiki's own `action=parse` renders of its wikitext pages (default Librarybase), pinned by `oldid`, as golden fixtures for the built-in renderer: per revision the source (`.wiki`), the HTML (`.html`) and the rest of the parse (`.json`), plus a `manifest.json`. `--history` parses every revision; reruns fetch only what is missing. |
| `talk_dumps.py` | Downloads wiki talk pages as XML dumps for the talk-page conversion (0054 §5): the latest revision of some pages through the Action API's `export`, every revision of others through `prop=revisions` written in the same export-0.11 shape, and DiscussionTools' `discussiontoolspageinfo` reading of each dumped revision, pinned by `oldid`. Defaults to a sample of odd English Wikipedia talk pages. Dumps are kept once written, so reruns fetch only what is missing. |
| `talk_split.py` | The reference prototype of the talk-page splitter (0090 §2–§3, §9): splits a dump's or a `.wiki` file's talk pages into sections and signed comments, with depth, parents, undated signatures and DiscussionTools names and IDs; `--page TITLE` prints a comment tree. The Rust splitter in `scatter-talk` is measured against it. |
| `talk_compare.py` | Compares `talk_split.py` with DiscussionTools on the samples `talk_dumps.py` writes: comments, parents, names and IDs per page (`--show TITLE` lists one page's disagreements); `--attribution` replays `history.xml.gz` with a line-level blame and counts who added each signature (0090 §13). |
| `api_check.py` | Checks adopted entities through the Action API after `adopt` (test plan §1.3–1.4): `Special:EntityData`, `wbgetentities`, `wbsearchentities`, `view.identifier`, snak datatypes, and with `--compare` the source wiki's output. With `--wbi-login` it runs the WikibaseIntegrator section: bot login, label edit, statement add/remove, a stale `baserevid` refused, a new item (and property) above the counter floor. |
| `pwb_check.py` | The same story through Pywikibot: generates a family file and config in a temporary directory, then site info, paraminfo, data repository, login, read, property, search, `editLabels`, `addClaim`, `removeClaims`, stale `baserevid`, new item; then a Project page through `Page.save`, created, edited, a stale save refused, and rendered by `action=parse`. Needs `pywikibot`. |
| `wdi_check.py` | The same through WikidataIntegrator, with its SPARQL backoff bounded and its endpoint pointed at the server: login, read, search, property, `set_label` + `write()`, `WDString` append, stale and current `delete_statement`, new item. Needs `wikidataintegrator` and `setuptools<80`. |
| `client_compat.sh` | Runs all three against a server it sets up itself (database, `instance create`, `adopt` of the sample fixture, `sync`, a bot key with `editentity`, `createeditmovepage` and `highvolume`, `triplespace-server --ui off`), each as a hard pass/fail; CI's *Client compatibility* job. Needs the binaries built, `psql`, and a Python with `requirements-compat.txt` installed (`PYTHON=` to name it). Everything it writes is in a temporary directory removed on exit. `CHECKS="wbi pwb wdi"` selects, `KEEP_DB=1` keeps the database, `ITEM=Q5` names the item to edit (default: the lowest-numbered item), `FIXTURE=` another dump. |
| `adr.py` | Looks things up in the ADRs and chapters in one call: `show 0013 §7` (an ADR section, following its pointer to the chapter text), `where <phrase>` (chapter sections, ADRs and registry files, best first), `log 0008 [A6]`, `questions 0090`, `outline 05`. Prints links between docs as plain citations to keep output short (`--raw` keeps them). |
| `dev_env.sh` | Prepares a Debian or Ubuntu sandbox for the full suite: installs and starts Postgres, creates a role that may create databases and roles, proves it can, and installs the pinned client libraries into `.venv`. Falls back to stable Rust, with a warning, when the pinned toolchain can't be downloaded. Prints `export` lines: `eval "$(tools/dev_env.sh)"`. `--ui` adds `npm ci`, `--nextest` installs cargo-nextest, `--no-compat` skips the Python clients. Idempotent. |
| `requirements-compat.txt` | The pinned client versions `client_compat.sh` is run against. A bump is deliberate: run the script, then record the versions and verdict in the test plan's results log and `docs/clients.md`. |

The three checks take `--api` (default `http://127.0.0.1:8080`), the bot login as `--login
name@label` (`--wbi-login` for `api_check.py`), and the secret as `--secret` or
`TRIPLESPACE_WBI_SECRET`. Their writes are permanent on the tenant they run against, so point
them at a test database; `--no-write` (Pywikibot and WDI checks) keeps to reads.

## The Librarybase sample fixture

`crates/triplespace-server/tests/fixtures/librarybase-sample.xml.gz` is 200 random Librarybase
items with every property page, made from the frozen 2026-10-05 dump:

```sh
tools/dump_slice.py librarybase-20261005.xml.gz \
    crates/triplespace-server/tests/fixtures/librarybase-sample.xml.gz \
    --sample 200 --seed 1 --all-properties --include Q1 --defined-only
```

Made from the full dump, `--defined-only` drops nothing and `Q1` (the Librarybase item itself)
is in; made from a prefix slice it drops the items whose properties the slice does not
define. The same seed on the same dump gives the same fixture (the gzip header's timestamp
differs; the XML does not). `adopt` is run on it without `--counters`, so the floors come from
the sample's highest IDs; the checks only require new entities to land above them.

## The Librarybase wikitext fixtures

`crates/scatter-wikitext/tests/fixtures/librarybase/` holds every revision of Librarybase's
wikitext pages with Librarybase's own `action=parse` render of each, made with:

```sh
tools/librarybase_parse.py crates/scatter-wikitext/tests/fixtures/librarybase --history
```

The golden test (`crates/scatter-wikitext/tests/golden.rs`) renders each revision and compares
it with Librarybase's after both are parsed as HTML5 and normalized. Revisions that are known
to differ are listed with their reason in `known-differences.txt` there; the test fails when
one of them starts matching, so the list stays true. The MediaWiki-namespace pages are
fetched but not compared: Triplespace keeps that namespace reserved (11 §2.3).
