# Testing against real dumps

- **Goal:** take Milestone 1 from "passes on sample dumps" to "runs on the real ones", in three
  stages: adopt Librarybase → sync internetdomains.wiki as a key-mapped provider → sync Wikidata as a
  prefixed provider.
- **History:** written 2026-10-04 against `4b8d63a`; stage 1 completed 2026-10-06 and its checks run
  in CI (§1.5). Moved into the repo on 2026-10-21 from a working note. Measurements and the
  write-path analysis are in [`performance.md`](performance.md).
- **Where to run:** a Linux VM (Debian) or a Mac, from the repo checkout, with a local Postgres.
  Work files go in `~/ts-test/`. Commands assume Linux; macOS differences are noted.

## What the code can and cannot do today

Read this before stage 1, because one of these points changes the stage 1 commands.

1. **The set of providers is fixed when the instance is created.** `instance create --provider …`
   opens the mirror partitions, and no command adds one later. If an instance should ever sync
   Wikidata, pass `--provider wikidata` to `instance create` as well as `--provider internetdomains`.
   The stage 1 commands below do that.
2. **`triplespace sync` only works for `internetdomains`.** The pieces for Wikidata exist
   (`scatter_adapter_wikidata::mirror::mirror_entity`, `WikibaseAdapter::new("wikidata")`,
   `Entities::open` for JSON and XML), so the missing `prepare_wikidata` branch is short. Stage 3
   starts by adding it (3.0).
3. **`sync` loads the entire dump into memory first.** It collects every `SyncItem` into a `Vec`
   before `run_sync` begins, even though `run_sync` accepts any `IntoIterator`. That is fine for
   internetdomains and the 50k Wikidata sample, and impossible for `latest-all.json.gz` (about 115M
   entities). 0013 §9 bootstrap mode (COPY, deferred indexes) is not built either. The full
   Wikidata sync is therefore blocked on code; stage 3 measures what is needed and stops at a slice.
4. **Known Milestone 1 gaps these tests will hit:** the snapshot sweep tombstones a Domain that is no
   longer in the dump, where 0009 §9 wants an empty `put`; `wbsetsitelink`, `wbgetclaims` and
   `wbmergeitems` are not served; `verify` is not written.
5. **Found by stage 1 and fixed:**
   - The stored JSON in an XML dump has no `datatype` on snaks, so adopted snaks were untyped and
     `view.identifier` stayed empty (`3d84c87`; [`performance.md`](performance.md) §2).
   - The Postgres-backed test files dropped every scratch database the process had created, with
     `FORCE`, at the end of each test: a race that terminated sibling tests' connections (`57P01`).
     Each test now drops only its own (#60).
   - Pywikibot and WikidataIntegrator needed server fixes, recorded in
     [`../clients.md`](../clients.md).

## Stage 0: build, preflight and a rehearsal adoption

### 0.1 Build and run the suite against a real database

```sh
cd ~/git/triplespace
git switch main && git pull && git status
cargo build --release --workspace
(cd ui && npm ci && npm run build) && cargo build --release -p triplespace-server -p triplespace-web   # embeds ui/dist

# The tests connect as an admin and CREATE DATABASE one scratch DB per test, so the role needs
# CREATEDB (and CREATEROLE: triplespace-db's tests create roles). tokio-postgres reads neither
# PGPASSWORD nor ~/.pgpass. On Debian, TCP to localhost wants a password ("password missing"), so use
# the Unix socket and peer auth instead:
sudo -u postgres psql -c "ALTER ROLE $USER CREATEDB CREATEROLE;"   # or: createuser --createdb --createrole
# Keep it URL-shaped: several test suites and ui/e2e/run.sh swap the database by replacing the text
# after the last "/", which breaks key=value strings and ?host=/path forms. A percent-encoded socket
# directory keeps that working:
export TRIPLESPACE_TEST_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$USER@%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql/postgres"
# (macOS/Postgres.app with trust auth: postgres://localhost/postgres also works)
# Use the same shape for TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL below.
cargo nextest run --workspace          # or: cargo test --workspace
cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets -- -D warnings
cargo xtask deps

export PATH="$PWD/target/release:$PATH"
mkdir -p ~/ts-test && cd ~/ts-test
```

**Pass:** everything is green. Check that the database suites actually ran: without the env var they
print "skipping" and pass vacuously. The suites that need the database:
`scatter-log-postgres/tests/postgres.rs`, `triplespace-db/tests/db.rs`,
`triplespace-projections/tests/{step1,steps}.rs`, `triplespace-api-ingest/tests/end_to_end.rs`,
`triplespace-accounts/tests/accounts.rs`, `triplespace-server/tests/{acceptance,forwarded,site}.rs`.

### 0.2 Rehearsal on the Open Miscellaneous Wikibase dump

`OPEN_MISC_DUMP-2026-01-16.xml.gz` is a 30 KB full-history XML dump of other.wikibase.cloud (James
has it; it is not in the repo). It exercises the whole adoption path in seconds, including
multi-revision pages, a redirect and non-entity pages, before the one-way door. Copy it to
`~/ts-test/`.

The dump has 57 pages; the highest page ID is 57 and the highest revision ID 206. There are 34 items
(Q1–Q34) and 12 properties (P1–P12). Main Page is a redirect, and there are 10 other wikitext pages.
Three accounts appear: Harej (1), Zblace (3) and R74n (4).

```sh
createdb ts_rehearsal
export TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$USER@%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql/ts_rehearsal"
echo 'rehearsal passphrase' > owner.pw

triplespace instance create --key-file rehearsal.key \
    --tenant openmisc --base https://other.wikibase.cloud \
    --adopt https://other.wikibase.cloud/ \
    --owner 1 --owner-name Harej --owner-password-file owner.pw

triplespace adopt --tenant openmisc --dump OPEN_MISC_DUMP-2026-01-16.xml.gz \
    --source https://other.wikibase.cloud/ --version openmisc-20260116 --frozen
# expect: a warning about no --counters; adopted 46; rejected 0; accounts 3 (or 2 + owner)

triplespace adopt --tenant openmisc --dump OPEN_MISC_DUMP-2026-01-16.xml.gz \
    --source https://other.wikibase.cloud/ --version openmisc-20260116 --frozen
# expect: adopted 0, unchanged 46 (idempotent)

triplespace status
psql "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" <<'SQL'
SELECT type, count(*) FROM view.entity WHERE tenant='openmisc' GROUP BY type;            -- item 34, property 12
SELECT id, page_id, local_revid FROM view.entity WHERE tenant='openmisc' ORDER BY page_id LIMIT 5;
SELECT actor_key, name, kind FROM view.actor WHERE tenant='openmisc' ORDER BY actor_key;  -- openmisc:1 Harej, :3 Zblace, :4 R74n
SELECT sequencename, last_value FROM pg_sequences WHERE schemaname='log' AND sequencename LIKE 'openmisc.%';  -- item≥34, property≥12, page≥57, revision≥206, user≥4
SELECT job_id, status, counts FROM view.job WHERE tenant='openmisc';
SQL
```

**Pass:**
- Every page ID matches the entity's page in the dump. `local_revid` is a fresh local revision ID
  above the revision floor (0035 §3: an adopted record is an ordinary local revision; the source's
  revision ID is kept as `source_revid` in the content). Spot-check three multi-revision items: the
  content is the last revision's, not the first.
- Every sequence floor is at or above the dump's maximum.
- The redirect and the wikitext pages appear as skipped, not as rejected.

**Rebuild equivalence** (repeat after every stage):

```sh
pg_dump --data-only --schema=view "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" | sort > view-before.sql
triplespace rebuild
pg_dump --data-only --schema=view "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" | sort > view-after.sql
diff view-before.sql view-after.sql && echo REBUILD-IDENTICAL
```

Some columns may legitimately differ, such as projection timestamps. If they do, write down which
ones; don't accept the diff wholesale. One difference that is not data: recent `pg_dump` writes a
`\restrict <token>` / `\unrestrict <token>` pair with a random token per run, and those two lines
always differ.

**Negative tests:**
- A second `instance create` on this database must refuse to run.
- `adopt` without `--frozen` must refuse to run.
- Edit one entity's JSON inside a copy of the dump, then re-run `adopt` with that copy. Expect exactly
  one reject, and the stored entity must be unchanged.

## Stage 1: adopt Librarybase ✔ (2026-10-06)

### 1.1 On the source: freeze, then dump

The order matters: once the dump is taken, the source must stop accepting edits.

```sh
# librarybase.org host
# set $wgReadOnly = 'Migrating to Triplespace'; in LocalSettings.php and confirm an edit fails
php maintenance/run.php dumpBackup --current --include-files=no --quiet | gzip > librarybase-20261005.xml.gz
mysql -N -e 'SELECT * FROM wb_id_counters' <db>          # → item=…, property=…
mysql -N -e 'SELECT MAX(log_id) FROM logging' <db>       # → --log-floor
mysql -N -e 'SELECT user_id FROM user WHERE user_name="James"' <db>   # the owner's source user ID
# Did the wiki use federated properties / entity sources pointing at Wikidata? If so, note the prefix.
```

Copy the dump to `~/ts-test/`. Record its sha256 and its size.

### 1.2 Create the instance and adopt

```sh
createdb ts_lb
export TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL="postgresql://$USER@%2Fvar%2Frun%2Fpostgresql/ts_lb"
echo '<real passphrase>' > owner.pw && chmod 600 owner.pw

triplespace instance create --key-file triplespace.key \
    --tenant librarybase --base https://librarybase.org \
    --provider internetdomains --provider wikidata \
    --adopt https://librarybase.org/ \
    --owner <your source user_id> --owner-name James --owner-password-file owner.pw

/usr/bin/time -v triplespace adopt --tenant librarybase --dump librarybase-20261005.xml.gz \
    --source https://librarybase.org/ --version librarybase-20261005 --frozen \
    --counters item=<n>,property=<n> --log-floor <n> \
    2> adopt.stderr | tee adopt.out
#   add --entity-source wikidata=WD only if 1.1 said federated properties were used
```

`/usr/bin/time -v` reports wall time and peak RSS. Expect about 12 minutes for 247k entities
(2.9 ms/entity); [`performance.md`](performance.md) §3 has the `pg_stat_statements` recipe if it is
far off. The final `untyped N snaks on M properties …` line, if present, names properties the dump
does not define; on a full dump it should be absent.

To rehearse on a prefix of the real dump:
`tools/dump_slice.py librarybase-20261005.xml.gz slice-10k.xml.gz --limit 10000`. A prefix slice's
survey does not see properties defined later in the dump, so it reports untyped snaks the full dump
will not; `--all-properties` carries every property page along, and `--sample N --seed S` draws a
random sample instead (`tools/README.md`).

### 1.3 Checks

```sh
triplespace status        # every projection "current"
psql "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" <<'SQL'
SELECT type, count(*) FROM view.entity WHERE tenant='librarybase' GROUP BY type;
SELECT count(*) FROM view.term WHERE tenant='librarybase';
SELECT count(*) FROM view.identifier WHERE tenant='librarybase';   -- must be non-zero
SELECT count(*) FROM view.actor WHERE tenant='librarybase';
SELECT sequencename, last_value FROM pg_sequences WHERE schemaname='log' AND sequencename LIKE 'librarybase.%';
SELECT job_id, status, counts, started, finished FROM view.job WHERE tenant='librarybase';
SELECT line, reason FROM view.job_reject WHERE tenant='librarybase' ORDER BY line;
SQL
grep -c '^skipping page' adopt.stderr; grep '^skipping page' adopt.stderr | cut -d: -f2- | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head
```

**Pass:**
- adopted + rejected + unreadable add up to the survey's entity count (247,011 on the 2026-10-05 dump).
- Every reject and unreadable page has a reason you understand. Group the reasons; each distinct
  class is either a bug or an accepted limitation, so file it as one or the other.
- The floors equal the values passed to `--counters` and are at or above the survey's maximum page,
  revision and user IDs.
- Re-running the same adopt command gives `adopted 0` and is fast.
- Rebuild equivalence passes (0.2), and you record how long `rebuild` takes.

**Spot-check against the live (frozen) source.** After starting the server (1.4),
`tools/api_check.py` does the comparison:

```sh
tools/api_check.py --db "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" --sample 20 --compare https://librarybase.org/
tools/api_check.py --ids Q1 Q<max> P1 P<unusual datatype> …   --compare https://librarybase.org/
```

Per entity it checks:
- `Special:EntityData` serves it, and every snak (mainsnak, qualifiers, references) carries `datatype`.
- `wbgetentities` agrees and has `pageid`/`lastrevid`.
- `wbsearchentities` finds it by label. A label shared as a prefix by more than 50 records is a note,
  not a failure.
- `view.identifier` has a row per external-id mainsnak.
- The entity equals the source's `Special:EntityData` output minus `lastrevid/modified/pageid/ns/title`.
- `pageid` equals the source's.
- `lastrevid` is above the source's (0035 §3–4: a fresh local revision over the floor).

Pick IDs that include the lowest Q, the highest Q, every P with an unusual datatype, and a few
entities with heavy statements, qualifiers, references and many languages.

### 1.4 Serve and exercise the API

```sh
triplespace-server --database "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" --key-file triplespace.key \
    --mode development --dev-tenant librarybase --listen 127.0.0.1:8080 &

A=http://localhost:8080/w/api.php
curl -s "$A?action=query&meta=siteinfo&siprop=general|triplespace|providers&format=json" | jq .
curl -s "$A?action=wbgetentities&ids=Q1|P1&format=json" | jq '.entities|keys'
curl -s "$A?action=wbsearchentities&search=<a known label>&language=en&format=json" | jq '.search[].id'
curl -s "$A?action=query&list=logevents&letype=import&format=json" | jq '.query.logevents|length'

triplespace subsidiary create --tenant librarybase --name "James bot" --operator James --group bot
triplespace subsidiary key --tenant librarybase --name "James bot" --label test --grant editentity --grant highvolume
# --json prints {key_id, login, secret, bearer} for scripts
```

**WikibaseIntegrator** (the script does steps 1–3 and reads every write back):

```sh
tools/api_check.py --db "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" --ids Q1 \
    --wbi-login "James bot@test" --wbi-secret "$SECRET" --wbi-create-property
```

1. Edit a label, add a statement and remove a statement on an adopted item, passing `baserevid`; a
   stale `baserevid` must be refused (`editconflict`, 0006 §8).
2. Create a new item. Its ID must be above the item counter floor, never a reused number.
3. Create a new property, likewise above the property floor. (These writes are permanent.)
4. Open `/wiki/Item:Q<n>` in the browser: tabs, `uselang=de`, the term editor and the group editor.
5. Log in as the owner with `clientlogin` (plain `action=login` with the owner's password answers
   `ts-use-oauth`; bot passwords are for subsidiaries).
6. Run `rebuild` again and confirm the edits survive it.

**Pywikibot:** the same story through Pywikibot's own probes. The script writes its family file and
config into a temporary directory and uses a fresh API cache, so it tests the server as it is now
(Pywikibot's 30-day API cache otherwise masks whether a fix worked):

```sh
tools/pwb_check.py --login "James bot@test" --secret "$SECRET" --item Q1 --item-floor <item counter>
```

**WikidataIntegrator** (`setuptools<80`):

```sh
tools/wdi_check.py --login "James bot@test" --secret "$SECRET" --item Q1 --item-floor <item counter>
```

Each prints `N passed, M failed, K skipped` and exits non-zero on any failure. What each library
needs from the server is in [`../clients.md`](../clients.md).

### 1.5 The same, in CI

`tools/client_compat.sh` does 1.2–1.4 unattended against the Librarybase sample fixture (made from
the full dump, `tools/README.md`) and the internetdomains fixture, then runs all three client checks;
any failure fails the run. CI's *Client compatibility* job runs it on every push with the clients
pinned in `tools/requirements-compat.txt`. Bumping a pin is a deliberate change whose result goes in
the results log below and in `docs/clients.md`.

Locally: `python3 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -r tools/requirements-compat.txt`, then
`TRIPLESPACE_TEST_DATABASE_URL=… PYTHON=.venv/bin/python tools/client_compat.sh` (about 90 seconds
after the build; `CHECKS="pwb"` for one, `KEEP_DB=1` to inspect).

## Stage 2: sync internetdomains.wiki (keyed entities)

Use the same `ts_lb` database, so that Domains sit next to the adopted entities. Migration 0008 must
be in: it keeps the per-mirror-record `overlay_tenants` lookup from scanning the adopted rows.

### 2.1 Get the dump

On the internetdomains.wiki host:

```sh
php maintenance/run.php dumpJson --entity-type item --entity-type property | gzip > internetdomains-20261005.json.gz
# or an XML dump (Special:Export works without shell access); sync accepts either
```

### 2.2 First sync (upsert)

```sh
/usr/bin/time -v triplespace sync --provider internetdomains \
    --dump internetdomains-20261005.json.gz --version 20261005 2> sync-xd.stderr | tee sync-xd.out
head -3 sync-xd.stderr      # "N entities, M mapped to domains, K keys in conflict"
```

### 2.3 Checks

```sh
psql "$TRIPLESPACE_DATABASE_URL" <<'SQL'
SELECT type, count(*) FROM view.entity WHERE id LIKE 'domain:%' OR id LIKE 'XD%' GROUP BY type;
SELECT count(*) FROM view.keyed_map WHERE provider='internetdomains';
SELECT key, count(*) FROM view.keyed_map GROUP BY key HAVING count(*)>1;                 -- must be empty
SELECT reason, count(*) FROM view.job_reject r JOIN view.job j USING (tenant, job_id)
  WHERE j.source='internetdomains' GROUP BY reason;
SELECT entity_id, upstream_version FROM view.entity_source WHERE graph='mirror/internetdomains' LIMIT 5;
SELECT upstream_id, key FROM view.keyed_map WHERE key ~ '^xn--' LIMIT 5;                   -- IDN normalized to A-label
SQL

curl -s "$A?action=wbgetentities&ids=domain:wikipedia.org&format=json" | jq .
curl -s "$A?action=wbgetentities&ids=XDP1|XDQ<an unmapped item>&format=json" | jq '.entities|keys'
curl -s "$A?action=wbgetentities&ids=domain:never-heard-of-this.example&format=json" | jq .   # empty-but-valid Domain (0009 §4)
```

**Pass:**
- mapped + unmapped + rejected equals the entity count, and the "K keys in conflict" figure matches
  the duplicate rejects.
- Every rejected item still exists as an `XDQ` item that keeps its `P1`.
- A mapped Domain has no `P1`.
- A statement upstream that pointed at a mapped item is now a `wikibase-domain` value. Find one
  `Q`→`Q` link in the source and check it.
- `Domain:` pages render in the site (`/wiki/Domain:wikipedia.org`, Identifiers tab).
- If the input is an XML dump, snaks still carry `datatype`.

### 2.4 Local assertions on a foreign key (resolution)

With the bot account:
1. Add a statement and an English label to `domain:wikipedia.org`.
2. Read it back. You should get the union of the statements, with the local label winning (0013 §5.1).
3. Confirm the mirror's partition is untouched: the local edit went to `local`, not to
   `mirror/internetdomains`.
4. Edit an `XDQ` item locally. Same expectations.

### 2.5 Re-sync and snapshot

```sh
triplespace sync --provider internetdomains --dump internetdomains-20261005.json.gz --version 20261005
# expect: created 0, updated 0, unchanged = all (the cursor works)

# Edit 2 items upstream, delete 1, add 1. Take a new dump:
triplespace sync --provider internetdomains --dump internetdomains-20261006.json.gz --version 20261006 --snapshot --threshold 10
# expect: created 1, updated 2, tombstoned 1
```

Then check:
- The local statement added in 2.4 survives the upstream update to the same Domain.
- If the deleted item was a mapped Domain, it is tombstoned. That is the known gap (0009 §9 wants an
  empty `put`); record the behaviour, since the fix will be tested against it.
- `--threshold 0` with one deletion fails the job rather than sweeping.
- Rebuild equivalence passes.

## Stage 3: sync Wikidata

Read [`performance.md`](performance.md) §6 first: it sets expectations (2–4 weeks for the full dump
on the per-entity path) and names the design question (whether mirror entities populate `view.term`
at all) to settle before 3.2. Note also that `rebuild` replayed Librarybase's 247k records in
10 minutes, nearly the adoption's 12: the catch-up path costs about what the inline path does, and it
is the path a Wikidata resolution pass would take, 500 times over.

### 3.0 Prerequisite code

On one branch, before any testing:
- Add `prepare_wikidata` to `sync.rs`: `Entities::open`, then `mirror_entity` with
  `WikibaseAdapter::new("wikidata")`, then `SyncItem::State`. Dispatch on `adapter` in
  `providers.toml` rather than on the slug, so that other Wikibases can share it.
- Make the sync stream: pass `run_sync` an iterator instead of a `Vec`. This works for upsert mode;
  snapshot mode needs a set of the IDs it has seen, so the full dump cannot be swept yet.

### 3.1 The 50k sample

`docs/api/snapshots/big/wikidata-20261004-sample-50000.json.gz` holds 50,000 uniformly random items
and all 13,972 properties, in the dump's shape (see its manifest).

```sh
cp ~/git/triplespace/docs/api/snapshots/big/wikidata-20261004-sample-50000.json.gz ~/ts-test/
/usr/bin/time -v triplespace sync --provider wikidata \
    --dump wikidata-20261004-sample-50000.json.gz --version sample-20261004 2> sync-wd.stderr | tee sync-wd.out
```

**Pass:**
- created + rejected + unreadable equals 63,972.
- Every unreadable entity and reject is grouped by cause. This is the datatype-coverage test:
  lexeme, form and sense values, `musical-notation`, `geo-shape`, `tabular-data`, `entity-schema`
  and Commons media should all parse.
- `SELECT type, count(*) FROM view.entity WHERE id LIKE 'WD%' GROUP BY type` gives 50,000 items and
  13,972 properties.
- `wbgetentities&ids=WDQ<sampled>` round-trips against `Special:EntityData` on wikidata.org with IDs
  rewritten: every `Q…` and `P…` becomes `WDQ…`/`WDP…`, including statement GUID prefixes, qualifier
  and reference snaks and `snaks-order`.
- `/wiki/Item:WDQ<sampled>` renders. Labels for entities outside the sample show as IDs, which is
  expected.
- **Cross-graph:**
  - A sampled item's label is found by search, from the Wikidata mirror, next to local results.
  - If Librarybase was adopted with `--entity-source wikidata=WD`, adopted statements that point at
    `WDQ…` now resolve labels for the sampled entities. If not, Librarybase's external-ID links to
    Wikidata are just strings, and that is expected.
- Re-sync: everything comes back unchanged.
- Record entities per second, peak RSS, database size
  (`SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()))`) and the `pg_stat_statements`
  per-entity table ([`performance.md`](performance.md) §3).

### 3.2 A real-dump slice

Download `latest-all.json.gz` (about 140 GB) from dumps.wikimedia.org and cut a prefix rather than
writing a new reader:

```sh
zcat latest-all.json.gz | head -n 1000001 | sed '$ s/,$//' | { cat; echo ']'; } | gzip > wd-slice-1m.json.gz
triplespace sync --provider wikidata --dump wd-slice-1m.json.gz --version slice-1m-<dumpdate>
```

The dump is ordered by ID, so the first million entities are old, dense, heavily linked items: the
worst case for size per entity. Record the same measurements as in 3.1 at 1M, then repeat with 5M if
the 1M run looks linear.

### 3.3 Extrapolate and decide

From 3.1 and 3.2, project the full sync's wall time, database size and log size.

- **Stop here** unless the projection is acceptable through the normal append path. On the evidence
  so far it will not be ([`performance.md`](performance.md) §6).
- The full run then needs 0013 §9 bootstrap mode (batch-shaped writes, deferred indexes, set-based
  projections) and a streaming snapshot sweep. Those are separate pieces of work, not something the
  test can push through.
- Keep the slice instance: it is the baseline the bootstrap work is measured against.

## Results log
