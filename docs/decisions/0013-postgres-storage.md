## Context

The ADRs so far describe Triplespace's data as RDF. Source graphs hold quads ([0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §2), the resolved view and the metadata graph are projections ([0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md), [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §3), and the shared storage contract is `lookup(s, p, o, g)` ([0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §4.4). RDF is the right model: it is what the Wikibase contract exports, what QLever loads, and what Scatterbase shares.

It is the wrong thing for the API and the site to read from. Everything the later ADRs ask the server to do is a keyed lookup or an ordered list, not a graph pattern:

- serve an entity's canonical JSON and the labels of the entities it links to ([0003](0003-statement-ui.md) §2);
- resolve a title, an ID, a domain key or a cluster member to a page ([0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §3, [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §4);
- list history, recent changes, contributions and log events in one total order with continuation ([0010](0010-site-ui.md) §5–8, [0012](0012-api-requirements.md) §2.3);
- find an entity by an identifier value, for match keys and inferred links ([0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.5, [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §3);
- find everything that refers to an entity, when its cluster changes or for "Links here" ([0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) Consequences, [0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §10);
- check a base offset on write ([0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §8);
- allocate global revision and log IDs ([0012](0012-api-requirements.md) §2.1).

[0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md) §2 originally gave the metadata graph to "the Triplespace application only", for history views, attribution, diffs and moderation. [0010](0010-site-ui.md) §13 and [0012](0012-api-requirements.md) §3 then designed those views on an **activity projection**, a time-ordered index, without SPARQL. The ADRs have already moved to a position where RDF is the model and the export, and something else serves the application. This ADR names that something.

Every store the ADRs already require is a relational table in disguise:

| Store | Required by |
|---|---|
| Version cursor: upstream version and content hash per mirrored entity | [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.4, [0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §3, §8 |
| Uniqueness index on match-key properties | [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.5 |
| Reverse index from each cluster member to the statements that refer to it | [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) Consequences |
| Clusters, links by tier, held conflicts | [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §2, §10 |
| Correction states: active, redundant, dangling | [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §7, [0003](0003-statement-ui.md) §4 |
| Actor records, surrogates, and the private binding lookup | [0007](0007-actor-identity.md) §3–5 |
| Title index, page table, links projection | [0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §4, §10 |
| Keyed-type surrogates and the upstream ID ↔ key map | [0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §7, §9 |
| Activity projection | [0010](0010-site-ui.md) §13 |
| Jobs, checkpoints and segment manifests | [0011](0011-logs.md) §6.3, [0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §6 |
| Global revision and log ID allocation | [0012](0012-api-requirements.md) §2.1 |

MediaWiki is the precedent. Its `page`, `revision`, `slots` and `content` tables hold metadata and a `content_address` that points at the text in external storage. Wikibase adds a normalized term store (`wbt_item_terms`, `wbt_term_in_lang`, `wbt_text_in_lang`, `wbt_text`), `wb_items_per_site` for sitelinks, `wb_id_counters`, `wb_property_info` and `wb_changes`. The entity JSON itself is opaque to the database; every query the wiki needs to answer has its own table.

PostgreSQL is already part of the deployment stack, and the only question the storage-engine decision in [0000](0000-init.md) has left is whether the log itself goes into it, or only the projections.

## Consequences

- **One durable system.** The log, its proofs, every projection and the private store share one backup, one replication stream and one recovery point. The storage-engine question open since 0000 is closed.
- ~~**Interactive writes are one transaction.** Append, ID allocation, base-offset check and the synchronous projections commit together. There is no window in which an editor's own edit is invisible to them.~~ *The appending transaction records and nothing composes inside it; the written entity is composed after commit, before the response, so the editor's next read still hits (A53).*
- **Storage at Wikidata scale is estimated, not measured.** A `latest` mirror of Wikidata is on the order of 1 TB of record bodies before compression; `entity_ref` and `term` are each on the order of 10^9 rows. The materialize-only-when-different rule (§5.1) keeps the resolved view from doubling the first figure. The bootstrap audit must measure all three before a full load is attempted. `term` is bounded by the instance's term languages and `entity_ref` may be omitted on the Wikidata profile (A52).
- **Erasure has an operational tail.** An `UPDATE` erases the live tuple; `VACUUM` and WAL retention decide when the bytes are gone. The runbook, not the schema, guarantees the deadline.
- ~~**Postgres is on the append path.** Local appends are serialized per partition by a row lock, which caps single-partition write throughput at what one transaction stream can do. That is well above what human editing produces, and bulk ingest does not use that path.~~ *The lock covers the append alone, so the ceiling is the append rate, not the projection rate; bulk append into a live partition takes it once per block, and only bootstrap of an empty partition bypasses it (A53).*
- **Scatterbase gains a Postgres backend without asking for one.** `scatter-log-postgres` is a substrate crate; its claim partition can live in Postgres or in files with no change above the trait.
- **The quad store is demoted.** Anything that assumed the metadata graph would be queried by the application has to read `view` instead. Nothing in 0010–0012 did.
- **Privacy is enforceable in two places.** The route-level test of 0012 §8 and the grant-level separation of §4 have to agree; a table that moves between schemas changes what a role can read.
- ~~**Migrations become part of the compatibility surface.** A `view` change needs a rebuild or a migration; a `log` change needs a new payload or header version and a migration that keeps every existing header verifiable.~~ *Only a change to what `log` records are; a change to how they are stored needs a migration alone (A31).*
- **Migrations become part of the compatibility surface.** A `view` change needs a rebuild or a migration. A change to what `log` records are needs a new payload or header version and a migration that keeps every existing header verifiable; a change to how they are stored that keeps every record's logical bytes ([0058](0058-packed-record-storage.md) §1) needs only a migration.

## Open questions

- **Q1. Measured sizes.** Record, `entity_ref` and `term` sizes for a full Wikidata mirror, and the compression ratio of canonical CBOR under `lz4` versus `zstd` (which needs an extension or a newer Postgres).
- **Q2. Where large mirrors live.** Whether mirror child tables should go to a separate database or tablespace, or whether their bodies should move to object storage behind the same `LogStore` trait once measured sizes justify it. Sharding is out of scope until then.
- **Q3.** ~~**Whether `revid` and `logid` enter the header.** Left to the global-ID ADR, which this ADR otherwise answers.~~ *Settled by [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2: they do, with `page_id`, as header fields 7–9 inside the Merkle tree.*
- **Q4. Statement rows for the local graph.** Whether `statement_assertion` should also index property and rank for every local statement, so that per-property views of large local entities can be paged in SQL instead of from the blob.
- **Q5. Vacuum policy.** How soon after an `erase` the affected child table is vacuumed, and whether `VACUUM FULL` is the default for reason class `legal`.
- **Q6.** ~~**Which projections are synchronous.** §7 puts 1–5 in the write transaction. `entity_ref` for an entity with tens of thousands of referrers may be too slow; the threshold at which a projection goes asynchronous for one write is to be set from measurement.~~ *Settled by A11: a write's own rows are always synchronous; fan-out to other entities is inline up to `projections.sync_budget` / `projections.sync_time`, then queued with lag reported. The default values are tuning.* *Extended by A53: no projection runs inside the appending transaction; the written key is composed in the after-commit slot the two budgets bound, and every fan-out is the composition worker's, reported as lag from `ops.projection_work`.*
- **Q7.** ~~**`page_id` for entities on rebuild.** §6 assigns it from the entity's first record in append order. If two partitions first mention an entity in records that interleave differently on rebuild, the ID could differ; the rule may need to be "first record in the local partition, else first mirror record by partition number".~~ *Settled by [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2: the ID is in the header and carried forward, never derived.*
- **Q8. Partition count at farm scale** and whether small tenants share physical child tables ([0018](0018-tenants.md) Q1). [0028](0028-tenancy-policy.md) §2 adds three instance partitions per farm, which does not change the shape of the question.
- **Q9. The addressing projection's role.** §7 runs it under the notifier's role because it writes to `private`; whether `ops.projection_state` should record its position like the others, or `private.inbox` should carry its own high-water mark, is an implementation choice to settle with [0021](0021-notifications.md).
- **Q10.** ~~**A `NULL` tenant in a key.** §5 and [0018](0018-tenants.md) §6 give shared rows and instance-level registry entries a `NULL` tenant and say the tenant is in the key, but a Postgres primary key cannot hold `NULL`.~~ *Settled by A11: `tenant text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`, the empty string being the instance, leading every primary key; a read tries the viewer's tenant and falls back to `''`.*

## Amendment log

### A1. Crate table

- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Source:** [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §2, revision of 2026-09-26
- **Change:** supersedes §10
- **Summary:** 0005 §2 became the one crate table CI checks, and carries every crate of this section (0005 A8). The section was kept in step with it until this conversion: A2 renamed `erase_bodies`. It still named `sqlx`, which 0033 §4 replaced with `tokio-postgres` in 0005 §2's dependency notes.

Replaced text (§10):

> | Layer | Crate | Change |
> |---|---|---|
> | Substrate | `scatter-log` | Gains the `LogStore` trait: `append`, `read`, `scan`, `erase_parts` (named `erase_bodies` until [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §7), `compact`, `head`. Its file backend, `segments`, implements it and remains the export-bundle format. |
> | | `scatter-log-postgres` (new) | `LogStore` over the `log` schema of §2, with `sqlx`. It also owns that schema's migrations. Shared with Scatterbase, which may use it in place of files. |
> | | `scatter-projection` | The projection trait gains a transactional variant, so a projection can apply inside the appending transaction (§7). |
> | Triplespace | `triplespace-db` (new) | The `view`, `private` and `ops` schemas, their migrations, roles and grants (§4), connection pools, and replica routing (§7) |
> | | `triplespace-projections` (new) | Every `view` projection of §5, in the order of §7. Absorbs `triplespace-activity` from [0010](0010-site-ui.md) §13. Pure computation stays in `scatter-wikibase-resolve`, `scatter-identity` and the other core crates; this crate only reads records and writes rows. |
> | | `triplespace-rdf` (new) | The streaming RDF projection of §8, using `scatter-wikibase-rdf`. Absorbs `triplespace-revmeta`, the metadata-graph projection of [0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md) and [0011](0011-logs.md) §10. |
>
> The rules of [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §3 hold: no core crate depends on `sqlx` or Postgres, async and I/O appear only in `scatter-log-postgres`, `scatter-ingest` and the surfaces, and the `segments` backend keeps `scatter-log` usable without a database.

### A2. Header IDs, erasable parts and upstream revisions

- **Change:** amends §5, §5.2, §5.6; extends §4, §5.4, §5.5, §7, §8
- **Summary:** `partition` made `bigint` in `view.record_statement` and `view.activity` (and in `view.upstream_revision`, 0015 §4), which the head of §5 already required; `view.entity.deleted`, `view.page.reserved`, `view.actor.operator`, `groups`, the `kind` and `status` vocabularies, and `view.activity.patrolled` with its partial index written into the SQL they were listed against in §5.6; the `private` and `ops` cells of §4 list keys, tokens, consumer secrets, preferences, the hit IP row, per-actor ActivityPub keys, and the export, filter-test and re-check jobs; `triplespace-federation` named as the third reader in the table; the write path of §7 stated in order, with `filter` in step 1, `keyed_map` in step 2, `value_key` and `constraint_count` in step 4 and `filter_hit` in step 5; §5.6 gains the `ops` job rows, the rewritten `sitelink`, `view-pin` and `resolver`; the `NULL`-tenant key question added below. The sitelink table was rewritten (0026), `notification_pref` was dropped for preferences (0027), and `ap_inbox_seen` joined `ops` (0022 §8). 0022 §1's local-graph source dump, which extends §8, was recorded only in 0022 until this conversion.

Replaced text: not recorded. 0013 was revised in place before the repository's history begins (commit `1e53c95`, 2026-09-27).

### A10. The SPARQL Update stream

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** [0032](0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §1–3, §7, §9
- **Change:** amends §8; extends §5.6, §7
- **Summary:** By section:
  - §5.6, §7, §8: `view.rdf_delta` and the delta epoch in §5.6; the delta projection noted in §7; §8 amended: stamped and skolemized dumps, and the local quad store fed from the delta table.
  - §8: Every dump is stamped with the cursor of the SPARQL Update stream it continues into, and is offered in a second form with blank nodes skolemized (0032 §7); the plain form is unchanged. The local quad store is no longer a separate projection: it is fed from `view.rdf_delta`, the same rows the stream serializes, in process through `scatter-quadstore::apply` or externally through `triplespace-cli sparql-sync` (0032 §9).

Replaced text (§8):

> - **A local quad store is a deployment option.** An instance that wants its own SPARQL endpoint runs the quad projection into Oxigraph or QLever as one more consumer of the log.

### A11. Decisions of 2026-09-27 (evening)

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** Direct: James, decisions of 2026-09-27 (evening)
- **Change:** amends §5; extends §4, §5.4, §5.6, §7
- **Summary:** By section:
  - §4, §5.6: Password hashes for the built-in `password` issuer live in `private.password` (decision 1, recorded as 0007 A3). Names a local account releases are kept as keyed hashes in `private.name_tombstone`, so that no name is ever reused (decision 7, recorded as 0010 A6).
  - §5: `tenant text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` leads every primary key, the empty string being the instance; a read tries the viewer's tenant, then `''` (decision 3). This settled Q10.
  - §7: A write's own rows are always synchronous: the written entity's or page's resolution, terms, identifiers, sitelinks, its own `entity_ref` rows, its own constraint checks ([0031](0031-property-constraints.md) §2), its activity row and its delta ([0032](0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §2). **Fan-out** to other entities, meaning referrers re-resolved by a cluster change ([0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md), Consequences), `type`, `inverse` and `symmetric` constraint re-checks of statements that point at the changed entity (0031 §2), and the deltas those produce, is applied inline until a budget is spent and then handed to the projection worker: `projections.sync_budget` (`site` configuration, default 1,000 rows) or `projections.sync_time` (default 250 ms), whichever comes first. The remainder is queued in `ops.projection_state` as work for the affected keys, applied in append order by the worker that serves bulk jobs, and reported as lag on the entity page's identity line ("N referrers updating") and in `siprop=triplespace`. Read-your-writes therefore holds for the thing edited and for small fan-outs; a link to a heavily cited author shows its effect on referrers within lag. The append lock of §2 is released at commit, before the queued remainder runs, so a large fan-out never blocks the next editor. (decision 6). This settled Q6.

Replaced text: not recorded. 0013 was revised in place before the repository's history begins (commit `1e53c95`, 2026-09-27).

### A12. Entity-ID sequences

- **Date:** 2026-09-28
- **Source:** [0035](0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) §4
- **Change:** extends §6
- **Summary:** Local entity IDs come from one more set of per-tenant sequences, one per minted entity type (`log.item_id`, `log.property_id`, …), taken in the appending transaction as Wikibase's `wb_id_counters` are; the ID blocks of [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.5 reserve ranges from them. An adoption sets every sequence here — entity, page, revision, log and user IDs — past what the source wiki consumed, records the floors in its job record, and supplies `page_id` for adopted records rather than taking one.

### A13. Page statements and categories

- **Date:** 2026-09-29
- **Source:** [0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10
- **Change:** extends §5.6, §7
- **Summary:** `page_statements`, `page_category`, `category`; page subjects in existing tables. §5.6 had been given its row in place; the projection steps it names were added to §7 at conversion.

### A14. Files

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0039](0039-files-and-media.md) §20
- **Change:** extends §5.6, §7
- **Summary:** File tables, `ops.upload_stash` and `ops.blob_delete`. §5.6 had been given its row in place; the file projection's step was added to §7 at conversion.

### A15. Content model IDs

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0041](0041-content-models.md) §10
- **Change:** amends §5.4
- **Summary:** `view.page.content_model` holds content model registry IDs. The SQL had been given the comment in place.

Replaced text: `content_model text NOT NULL, owner_actor text,` with no comment.

### A16. Tables written by rendering

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0042](0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10
- **Change:** amends §5.6; extends §7
- **Summary:** On a tenant with expansion on, `transclusion`, `render_state`, `entity_usage`, and the links, categories and file usage they drive are written by the refresh job and rebuilt by re-rendering, not by replay. Where a render read a foreign template repository or the clock, a rebuild can differ, so the first rule below does not hold for them. §5.6 had been given the table row in place.

Replaced text (§5.6):

> Every `view` table is a projection under §7 and is rebuilt from the log.

### A17. Entity usage

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0043](0043-lua-modules.md) §10
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.entity_usage`. §5.6 had been given its row in place.

### A18. The primary tenant

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0046](0046-primary-tenant.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §5.5
- **Summary:** `primary` is an instance-level kind, with the single code `primary`.

### A19. Reports and site statistics

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0047](0047-special-pages.md) §4.3, §13
- **Change:** amends §5.6; extends §7
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §5.6: A report configured as `batch` keeps a dated snapshot in `view.report_entry`. Like 0042 §10's tables, it is not a pure function of the log: a rebuild empties it, and the next scheduled run fills it. Projection-backed report rows are rebuilt with the tables they read. §5.6 had been given the table row in place.
  - §7: The `report` and `site_stats` projections run in step 5, after `activity` and `page_link`. Report entries are fan-out under the synchronous budget; the refresh job of 0042 §10 applies them for the tables it writes.

Replaced text: the rule as A16 states it, which this extended to batch reports.

### A20. Converted to the 0050 format

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §13
- **Change:** consolidates §4–12
- **Summary:** A1–A19 were folded into the Decision, and §12, the changelog of the 2026-09-27 revision, became the log: A2–A8 are its rows, A9 its third-pass row, which named ten ADRs, and A10 its 0032 row. The `Revised` header line is retired. The open questions were numbered. No decision changed. Before this, A10–A12, A16, A18 and A19 were blockquotes, A13–A17 and A19 had also been given rows or comments in place, and A9's local-graph dump was recorded only in 0022. The file before conversion is commit `0b26a3a`.

### A21. Redirects

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §5
- **Change:** extends §5.4, §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.redirect` and `is_redirect` on `view.page`, written in step 2.

### A22. The title index and ranged page IDs

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0052](0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6, §8
- **Change:** extends §5.6, §6
- **Summary:** `view.foreign_title` at instance scope; a repository page's `pageid` is provider-ranged, derived from its upstream page ID.

### A23. Bundles, cursors and the fetch queue

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0053](0053-mirrored-pages.md) §8
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.foreign_page`, `ops.repo_cursor` and `ops.page_fetch`; in `proxy` mode `foreign_page` indexes the L2 cache and is a projection of no log, which the two-rules paragraph now notes.

### A24. Forks

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0054](0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §3, §10
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.fork`, page subjects in `view.upstream_revision`, and `ops.fork`.

### A25. Page properties

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.page_prop`, MediaWiki's `page_props`; the properties a render sets are rebuilt by re-rendering, like the render tables.

### A26. Visibility tables

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0056](0056-security-model.md) §14
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.set_member`, `read_groups` on `view.activity`, `visibility_epoch` on `view.tenant`, and the `tenant` and `set` target kinds with a confidential-or-moderation `kind` on `view.acl`. Nothing is added to `private`.

### A27. Clarifications from the first implementation

- **Date:** 2026-10-02
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-10-02 (`scatter-log-postgres`, `triplespace-db`, `triplespace-projections`)
- **Change:** amends §2, §4, §5.4 and §7
- **Summary:** Five things the ADR left to the implementation, written down as built: `log.checkpoint.key_id` is the signed-note key hash; the database roles are named (`ts_server`, `ts_accounts`, `ts_notify`, `ts_federation`, `ts_verify`); the `group`, `membership`, `block` and `acl` tables that [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §9 names get their SQL, with a `layer` column for the instance floor of [0040](0040-instance-prerogatives.md) §5; an erased actor record projects a vanished row, created on replay if missing; queued fan-out lives in `ops.projection_work`, not in `ops.projection_state`, which holds positions only; and the replica route checks `pg_is_in_recovery()` before trusting a replay position.

Replaced text (§7): "The remainder is queued in `ops.projection_state` as work for the affected keys," and "a read is routed to a replica only when `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` on that replica has passed it, and to the primary otherwise." §2, §4 and §5.4 gain text.

### A28. Resolution as built

- **Date:** 2026-10-02
- **Source:** Direct: James, implementation of 2026-10-02 (`triplespace-projections`, `scatter-wikibase-resolve`)
- **Change:** extends §5.1, §7
- **Summary:** The `entity` projection writes `term` and `identifier` from the same resolution pass, so the three tables share one position; a rebuild orders partitions by dependency and the resolution projection fails loudly on a keyed subject without a surrogate. The `source` kind of §5.1 requires a whole-state record (`put`, or a `create`/`adopt` that is the only local record); an edited local entity is materialized. `resolved` is lz4-compressed by TOAST, not by the application.

### A29. Instance sequences and mirrored page IDs

- **Date:** 2026-10-03
- **Source:** Direct: James, decision of 2026-10-03 (`scatter-ingest`, `scatter-log-postgres`)
- **Change:** extends §6
- **Summary:** The instance's sequences (`job_id`, `log_id`, `page_id`, one surrogate counter per keyed type) live under the reserved tenant name `instance`; a mirrored entity's first record takes its page ID from the instance's `page_id` sequence, provider-ranged page IDs being for page repositories only; the per-tenant set gains `user_id`.

### A30. `private.session`

- **Date:** 2026-10-03
- **Source:** Direct: James, decision of 2026-10-03 (`triplespace-accounts`, `triplespace-api-action`, `triplespace-server`, `scatter-adapter-internetdomains`)
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `private.session (id text PRIMARY KEY, tenant, actor_key, key_id, created, expires, last_seen)`, `portability: never-leaves`: the session store of an instance without a shared cache (0014 A14). `id` is the cookie value, 32 random bytes; `actor_key` is NULL for an anonymous session that holds only tokens; `key_id` is the API key a bot-password login used, so revoking the key finds the sessions (0024 §4). Migration `0006_private_session`.

### A31. Packed record storage

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0058](0058-packed-record-storage.md) §1, §2, §6, §7
- **Change:** amends §2, Consequences; extends §3, §9
- **Summary:** A partition's `storage` is `plain` or `packed`. A packed body is stored as zstd, against a per-domain dictionary, over a packed form in which repeated subtrees named by `docs/registry/fragments.toml` are 16-byte keyed references into `log.fragment`, stored once per dedup domain (each tenant, and the instance's shared partitions). `log.record` gains `codec` and `dict`; `log.fragment_domain`, `log.fragment`, `log.dict` and `ops.fragment_candidate` are added. The logical bytes, header, leaf and commitment do not change, and every rebuilt body is checked against the commitment. Erasure and compaction make the removed refs candidates for a candidate sweep, which deletes unshared fragments; shared ones wait for a full sweep, which a `legal` erasure runs at once. Bootstrap writers pack in-process and merge fragments after the load. A storage-only change to the `log` schema no longer needs a format version.

Replaced text (§2):

> - **Bodies use TOAST with `lz4` compression.** Canonical CBOR compresses well, and `lz4` decompresses fast enough for the read path. Bodies are never queried inside the database; they are decoded by the server.

Replaced text (Consequences):

> - **Migrations become part of the compatibility surface.** A `view` change needs a rebuild or a migration; a `log` change needs a new payload or header version and a migration that keeps every existing header verifiable.

### A32. The query service reads the quad store

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0059](0059-query-service.md) §1
- **Change:** amends §8
- **Summary:** The local quad store gains exactly one reader, the query service: compiled queries that materialize scope membership and raw SPARQL for people, isolated per tenant by the protocol's dataset. "Nothing in the API reads from it" becomes "nothing reads from it but the query service". The store stays a consumer of `view.rdf_delta`, holds public form only, and is never the authority.

Replaced text (§8): none removed. The rule quoted in the Summary was stated in [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §4.4 (A10 here brought the store in as a consumer) and is amended there by 0005 A62.

### A33. Schema reports

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0064](0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §5
- **Change:** extends §5.6, §7
- **Summary:** `view.schema_report`; the scope, task and validation projections named at the end of step 7.

### A34. Caption terms

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0065](0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.term` rows keyed by `M` and `WDM` IDs.

### A35. Lexeme term kinds

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0066](0066-lexemes.md) §5
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** Term kinds 4–6 for lemmas, representations and glosses.

### A36. Shallow mirroring

- **Date:** 2026-10-07
- **Source:** [0070](0070-shallow-entity-mirroring.md) §6, §10
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** Mirrored entities write `term` rows only in configured languages; the fetch queue; cursors for entity streams.

### A37. Derived statements

- **Date:** 2026-10-07
- **Source:** [0071](0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `derivation`, `derivation_subject` and the extraction queue.

### A38. Publications

- **Date:** 2026-10-07
- **Source:** [0074](0074-publishing-a-scope-to-an-external-wiki.md) §8
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `ops.publication_page` and `private.publication_credential`.

### A39. Scope dumps

- **Date:** 2026-10-07
- **Source:** [0076](0076-dataset-publication.md) §6
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `ops.dump`.

### A40. Sealed manifests never change

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §3
- **Summary:** The sentence saying that the compaction worker re-signs the manifest of each segment it touched is struck: a compacted offset keeps its leaf ([0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) A14), so a sealed manifest never changes and nothing replaces it. (PENDING A1)

Replaced text (§3):

> The compaction worker re-signs the manifest of each segment it touched, listing the manifest it replaces.

### A41. `provider-readers` is tenant scope

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §5.6
- **Summary:** `provider-readers` is **tenant** scope, a record in the provider tenant's own `config` ([0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §3, [0028](0028-tenancy-policy.md) §5); the 0028 row of §5.6 says so instead of listing it beside the instance-level `tenancy` and `template` kinds. (Corrected 2026-10-08: first written as "add to §5.5's instance-level list", which 0015 §3 and 0028 §5 contradict.) (PENDING A5)

Replaced text (§5.6):

> | `log`, `view` | Instance partitions `actors/{farm}`, `accounts/{farm}`, `log/{farm}`; farm accounts in `actor` with a `NULL` tenant; the farm-wide name-registry index; `tenancy`, `template`, `provider-readers` in `registry` | Farm identity, global groups and blocks, templates | [0028](0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12 |

### A42. `foreign_page` in `proxy` mode indexes L1

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §5.6
- **Summary:** In `proxy` mode `view.foreign_page` indexes the **L1** (Valkey) cache, where [0014](0014-caches-and-search.md) §4 keys the bundle `fp:`, not L2; the 0053 row of §5.6 is corrected with [0053](0053-mirrored-pages.md) §8. (PENDING A7)

Replaced text (§5.6):

> | `view`, `ops` | `foreign_page` (instance scope); `ops.repo_cursor`, `ops.page_fetch` | The bundles the instance holds for repository pages, in `proxy` mode the L2 cache's index and in `mirror` mode the projection of `pages/{repo}`; the event cursor and fetch queue | [0053](0053-mirrored-pages.md) §8 |

### A43. Rows the schema map lacks

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** extends §5.4, §5.6
- **Summary:** §5.6 gains rows for `view.thread_attachment`, `view.foreign_thread`, `ops.upstream_post`, `view.scope`, `view.scope_member`, `view.sprint`, `view.task`, `file.mediainfo_id`, the [0058](0058-packed-record-storage.md) `log` and `ops` tables and columns, `ops.migration` and `view.page_text`; the catalogue in chapter 03 §5 is the draft. The `view.page` SQL of §5.4 gains `len`, `latest_at`, `revisions` and `random`, and `view.actor` gains `last_active`, the columns [0047](0047-special-pages.md) §13 adds. Found while writing chapter 03. (PENDING A9)

### A44. Step 2 of the projection order

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §7
- **Summary:** Step 2 of §7's projection order also names `redirect` ([0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §5), `page_prop` ([0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6) and `derivation` ([0071](0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12), which §5.6 already says run in step 2. (PENDING A10)

Replaced text (§7):

> 2. `entity_source`, `keyed_map` ([0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §9), `page`, `job`, `upstream_revision` ([0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §4), `page_category` and `category` ([0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10), and the file projection ([0039](0039-files-and-media.md) §20);

### A45. Session state

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** amends §4
- **Summary:** Session state lives in Valkey when a shared cache is configured and in `private` otherwise ([0025](0025-oauth-server.md) §8, [0014](0014-caches-and-search.md) §2); "sessions' secrets" in §4's `private` row means that fallback, not an unconditional home. (PENDING A12)

Replaced text (§4):

> | `private` | State that belongs to one account and has no public history: the accounts graph's binding index, password hashes for the built-in `password` issuer ([0007](0007-actor-identity.md) A3), sessions' secrets, IP addresses held for abuse handling and IP blocks, when each binding was last used ([0007](0007-actor-identity.md) §3, [0012](0012-api-requirements.md) §5, [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §3); the watch set and its Atom token ([0020](0020-change-feeds.md) §3); inboxes and read state ([0021](0021-notifications.md) §3); email addresses, fediverse handles, and the ActivityPub keys and followers of the notifier and of every opted-in actor ([0021](0021-notifications.md) §5, §8, [0022](0022-federation.md) §6); subsidiaries' API keys, OAuth tokens and confidential consumers' secrets ([0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §4, [0025](0025-oauth-server.md) §8); every preference, including the notification matrix and the auto-watch flags ([0027](0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §1); the IP row behind each edit-filter hit ([0030](0030-edit-filters.md) §11). §5.6 lists the tables | Permanent; never exported. The portable part travels with an account as a user data bundle, and with a cooperative tenant move as a sealed private extract applied on reclaim ([0027](0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §2–4); nothing else leaves ([0018](0018-tenants.md) §10) | `triplespace-accounts`, `triplespace-notify` and, for `ap_key` and `ap_follower` only, `triplespace-federation` |

### A46. Instance-scope `view` tables

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** extends §5
- **Summary:** A third class of `view` table, **instance scope**, with no `tenant` column: `foreign_title`, `foreign_page` and `foreign_thread`; and `rdf_delta`'s shared rows carry `tenant = ''`. The other two classes are the overlay tables of §5's tenant rule and the tables that are per tenant outright. (PENDING A13)

### A47. `view.tenant`

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** extends §5.5
- **Summary:** `CREATE TABLE view.tenant (tenant text PRIMARY KEY, visibility_epoch integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0)`, a projection of the tenant's `read` ACL records ([0056](0056-security-model.md) §7, §14); a tenant's configuration stays in `view.registry`. (PENDING B1)

### A48. Provider actor records

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** extends §5.4
- **Summary:** One actor record per provider, kind `provider`, in `actors/{provider}`, agent type `prov:Organization`, written when the provider is registered, so that every attestation, OpenAlex's mirror records included, names an actor key; it projects to a `view.actor` row of kind `provider`. The row's verb is amends, but §5.4 already lists `provider` among `actor.kind`'s values and contradicts nothing, so this entry extends; the text it replaces is [0007](0007-actor-identity.md) §6's "no actor records are kept". (PENDING C1)

### A49. The instance kinds are listed once

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** amends §5.5
- **Summary:** [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §3's scope paragraph is the one list of instance-level config kinds, gaining `reports`, `forwarder` and `page-repo` (tenant or instance); §5.5 refers to it instead of carrying its own list. (PENDING C18)

Replaced text (§5.5):

> `view.registry`'s key is `(tenant, kind, code)` since [0018](0018-tenants.md) §3 split the config kinds by scope; instance-level kinds (`key`, `graph`, `provider`, `issuer`, `keyed-type`, `tenant`, `alias`, and since then `tenancy`, `template`, `consumer`, the instance `sitelink-policy` and `federation-policy` lists, global `group`s, and `primary`, whose single code is `primary` ([0046](0046-primary-tenant.md) §2)) have the empty-string tenant.

### A50. `view.proposal`

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §5.6
- **Summary:** `view.proposal` ([0067](0067-proposals.md) §5) is a row of the schema map of §5.6 and of chapter 03 §5. (PENDING F28)

### A51. Current text relocated to the architecture chapters

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §14
- **Change:** relocates §1–§11
- **Summary:** The Decision's current text now lives in the architecture chapters [01](../architecture/01-log-and-records.md), [02](../architecture/02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md), [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md), [05](../architecture/05-providers-and-ingest.md), [22](../architecture/22-crates-and-stack.md), in the sections each pointer names; this ADR keeps its headings, provenance lines, Context, Consequences, Open questions and this log. The last commit in which this file carried the text is `c76d96f`. No decision changed.

### A52. Source form, the shared view under a policy record, and `term` and `entity_ref` at scale

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0082](0082-source-form-and-the-shared-view.md) §1, §5, §5.1, §6
- **Change:** amends §5, §5.1, §5.2, §5.3, §5.6, §11
- **Summary:** The stored graph is in source form: every `view` table keeps the entity IDs its source wrote, the canonical ID is an attribute of `view.cluster` and never applied to data, `materialized` means two or more contributing graphs or local deltas and nothing else, every member of a cluster keeps its row with the fused body stored once on the canonical member's row, and a cluster change recomposes the cluster's members only. The shared row (`tenant = ''`) of every `view` table is computed under the instance's `reconcile` policy record, which `view.entity.policy` names; a tenant narrows and never reorders, and a tenant-scope write that tries is refused with `ts-instance-policy`. `cluster`, `cluster_member`, `link`, `different_from` and `entity_source` gain the `tenant` column with the `''`-then-tenant lookup, `cluster_member`'s unique key is `(tenant, entity_id)`, and a read over shared rows by any key other than the entity (identifier by value, sitelink by URL, `entity_ref` by target, term by prefix) excludes shared rows of entities the viewer's tenant has overlaid; the overlay projection sets `tenant_overlaid` on the shared search document. `view.term` holds rows for local entities, overlaid entities and mirrored entities in the instance's term languages only, the rest served from the record through the L1 label cache; `term_prefix` is a partial index over tenant rows, never created or read on the large profile; `view.entity_ref` is keyed `(tenant, target_page_id, source_page_id, roles)` with a role bitmask and no `statement_id`, exists for "Links here" and the backlink count, and the Wikidata profile may omit it. The chapter also gives the quad store one shared resolved graph plus per-tenant overlay graphs, and the deployment profile table says the large profile leaves `term_prefix` in the schema unbuilt. (REVIEW G1, G2, G3, G7)

> **Tenants.** Under [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6, `view.entity` and the tables that hang off it (`term`, `sitelink`, `identifier`, `entity_ref`, `statement_assertion`, `correction`, `constraint_violation`, `value_key`) gain a `tenant text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` column that leads every primary key: the **empty string is the instance**, and the row with `tenant = ''` is the shared row computed from the shared source graphs; a tenant that has local assertions, a cluster link or a correction touching the entity has its own `(tenant, id)` row; a tenant with none reads the shared one. A read is therefore one primary-key lookup with the viewer's tenant, falling back to one with `''`.

But for most entities in a full mirror, exactly one graph contributes and no value refers to a clustered entity. For those, the resolved JSON *is* the mirror record's payload, which the adapter already wrote in prefixed-ID form ([0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.4). Storing it twice would double the largest table in the database. So:
>

> - If they match, `resolved_kind = 'source'` and `resolved` is `NULL`. A reader takes the body at `entity_source.offset`.
> - Otherwise `resolved_kind = 'materialized'` and `resolved` holds the JSON.
>
> **Only canonical members have a full row.** A non-canonical cluster member keeps its row for resolution (`canonical_id` points at the canonical entity), its `entity_source` rows and its terms in the per-graph views, but its resolved JSON is the canonical entity's.

This is §4.2's "materialize only where it differs", applied per tenant. `view.term`, `view.identifier`, `view.entity_ref`, `view.statement_assertion` and `view.correction` follow the same rule; `view.page`, `view.activity`, `view.job` and the actor tables are per tenant outright.

### A53. The write path in three tiers

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0083](0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §1, §2, §3, §4, §5, §6, §7
- **Change:** amends §2, §5, §5.1, §5.4, §5.5, §5.6, §7, §9
- **Summary:** Tier 1, the appending transaction, does only what is a function of the written record and the local graph (normalize, evaluate filters, check the base against the local graph, allocate IDs, append, write the written graph's state to `view.graph_state` and, for a local revision, `view.entity_revision`, write the activity row, commit); the partition lock covers exactly this and nothing composes inside it, so §7's "projections 1–5 for the affected keys before commit" is withdrawn, as is the synchronous budget's inline fan-out. Tier 2, composition, is a pure function of the contributing graph states, the policy record and the cluster map version, recorded as `composed_from`; it runs after commit for the written entity, in a coalescing worker for everything else, on miss on the read path, and set-based in bootstrap and bulk modes; a composed row is replaced only when its inputs are newer, `resolved_version` comes from an instance-wide sequence, and L1 is written by the composer after commit. Tier 3, the consumers of composition (constraints, scopes through `view.scope_trigger`, sprints and tasks, schema validation, entity usage, reports, the RDF delta behind `updates.enabled`, search documents, the ACL and visibility re-projections), each run on their own queue, never in a transaction, off during bootstrap and bulk modes; the statement and property ACL lookup is skipped while `view.tenant.live_statement_acls` is zero, and `view.activity` stores `read_enclosures` evaluated at serve time instead of `read_groups`. Every projection declares its class, log-replayed or view-derived; no projection has side effects during replay (blob destruction and adoption retirement are `ops` jobs); large projections rebuild into `view_next` and swap, and every rebuild bumps an instance-wide cache epoch carried in every L1 key; a tenant's partitions replay in `(appended_at, partition, offset)` order; decisions the write path makes from other partitions' state are written into the attestation part; `ops.projection_work` is the unit of truth for lag and `applied_offset` the contiguous prefix; `page_category`, `page_link` and `page_prop` carry `from_render` with one writer per row class. `rdf_delta.seq` is assigned by the one delta consumer, a rebuild truncates `rdf_delta`, and `ops.tenant_epoch` holds a per-tenant epoch with a rendering version. Bulk append into a live partition takes the lock once per block with the `put` skip evaluated in bulk, `stream` jobs are one transaction per block, and a new provider on a live instance is bootstrapped and then caught up against the live `view`. (REVIEW G8, G9, G10, G11, G12, G13, G14)

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §2.1, as it stood):

> **Offsets are allocated in the appending transaction.** The transaction locks the partition's row in `log.partition`, takes `next_offset`, inserts, and advances it. A rollback releases the offsets, so the sequence stays gapless as [0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §3 requires. Appends to one partition are serialized by that lock. This is the correct behaviour for the local partition, where edits must be ordered, and irrelevant for bulk ingest, which uses bootstrap mode ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §9).

A local entity that has been edited with `add` or `remove` is materialized even when it is the only graph, since no record holds its state. `resolved` is compressed by the column's TOAST method (`lz4`, as §2.1 compresses bodies); the projection writes the plain canonical JSON.

> 7. the RDF and search projections ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §8, in [02](../architecture/02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md); §11.3). The **delta projection** of [0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §2 is not a separate step: it runs inside steps 2, 4 and 7, wherever a projection has both the old and the new state of an entity in hand, and writes `view.rdf_delta` in the same transaction. The scope, task and validation projections ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §5, [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §6, [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §5) run at the end of this step, in that order, within the fan-out budget.
>
> Later ADRs place their projections in this order where their Storage sections say so: the ACL projection runs in step 1 with the permission tables, since resolution, terms, search and activity all read it, and it is synchronous for interactive writes, so a deletion is invisible the moment it commits ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10); `redirect` is written in step 2 with `page` ([0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5); the `derivation` projection runs in step 2 beside `entity_source`, and resolution of the subjects it names in step 4 ([0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12); the file projection runs in step 2 with pages, after the ACL projection ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20); lexeme terms are written by the term projection in step 4 ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5); the constraint projection runs in step 4 after `entity` and its dependents ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5); the thread tables are projections applied synchronously for interactive writes ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11).
>
> **One projection may own several tables.** The list above names tables; `term` and `identifier` are written by the `entity` projection from the same resolution pass, since each is a function of the resolved state and splitting them would resolve every subject three times. `ops.projection_state` has one row per projection, so their position is `entity`'s. A rebuild orders partitions by dependency: the `config` partition, then the instance `log` (surrogates, instance jobs), then mirrors, then tenant partitions; the resolution projection fails loudly on a keyed subject whose surrogate it cannot find ([0009](../decisions/0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §7).

The remainder is queued in `ops.projection_work` as work for the affected keys (one row per projection, tenant, record and key; `ops.projection_state` holds only positions), applied in append order by the worker that serves bulk jobs, and reported as lag on the entity page's identity line ("N referrers updating") and in `siprop=triplespace`. Read-your-writes therefore holds for the thing edited and for small fan-outs; a link to a heavily cited author shows its effect on referrers within lag. The append lock of §2.1 is released at commit, before the queued remainder runs, so a large fan-out never blocks the next editor. Report entries are fan-out under this budget; the refresh job of [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10 applies them for the tables it writes ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13).

- **Source:** [0084](0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §5
- **Change:** amends §5.1
- **Summary:** `view.entity.local_revid`, the `lastrevid` of the Action API, is the revision ID of the key's newest local record when it has one, and otherwise the provider-ranged ID of its newest mirror record; the base check of a write is per source graph, against the local partition's newest record for the key, and a mirror advancing is never a conflict. The 0084 table named §6 for this row; the chapter text that holds the rule is [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.2, which §5.1 points to, so the entry lands here. (REVIEW G17)

### A55. A mirrored entity's page ID is provider-ranged

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** amends §5.1, §5.4, §6
- **Summary:** A mirrored entity's page ID is provider-ranged, `provider_number << 40 | upstream page ID` where the provider publishes one and `provider_number << 40 | mirror offset` otherwise, computed by the writer with no allocation and no read of `view`; `log."instance.page_id"` is not used for entities; the sub-2^40 range of the page ID space is the tenant's own sequence, so one `pageid` space covers local pages, local entities and mirrored entities on a tenant without collision; and `view.entity`'s unique key on the page ID is `(tenant, page_id)`, since a shared row and a tenant's overlay row for one entity carry the same page ID. Chapter 10 §3.1 says "per tenant". (REVIEW G18)

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §2.3, as it stood):

> - `log.page_id` is taken the first time a key is written in any partition, and every later record for that key repeats it in header field 9 ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2). It is never derived from replay order. Talk pages take theirs from the same sequence through the thread record that first attaches to them ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §2).
> - Mirror records take a **provider-ranged** revision ID, `provider_number << 40 | n` ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2), computed by the writer with no allocation. A page served by a page repository takes a provider-ranged **page ID** the same way, `provider_number << 40 | upstream page ID`, derived and never minted; `log.page_id` therefore stays below 2^40 ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6).

### A56. The actor key is in the attestation part, never the header

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** corrects §5.4
- **Summary:** The actor key lives in the attestation part of a record and never in its header, except as the key of an actor record itself; the actor tables and `view.activity.actor_key` are projected from the attestation, which is why an attestation cut leaves the row with no actor; `view.activity`'s issuer index, and the `actor_local_name` index, filter on the tenant's derived issuer code ([0079](0079-derived-issuer-codes.md) §1), which `local` names. Chapter 07 §1.1's "what log headers carry" is struck. (REVIEW G19)

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.5, as it stood):

> ```sql
> CREATE UNIQUE INDEX actor_local_name ON view.actor (lower(name)) WHERE issuer = 'local' AND name IS NOT NULL;

### A57. No genesis records, manifests keyed per segment, `logid` for every tenant record, and concurrent appends

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Non-`config` partitions have no genesis record: a partition's name, hash function, `k` and policies are its `graph:` record in `config`, which the bundle carries, and `log.partition.hash` is denormalized from it. `log.segment_manifest` is keyed `(partition, segment)` with no `replaces` column and no `sealed_at` in the key; a manifest is signed once and never re-signed. A `hashed` partition has segment manifests only: its job-end "checkpoint" is the manifest of the last sealed segment plus an unsigned head offset, records in the open segment are uncommitted until sealed, and `log.checkpoint` rows exist for `logged` partitions only. Every record in `local`, `pages`, the tenant `log` and the tenant `actors` partitions takes a `logid` at append whether or not the catalogue projects it. Several processes append: the tree's right edge is read under the append lock and only complete subtrees are persisted, and checkpoints are signed by the projection worker under an advisory lock per partition, the only process holding the instance key.

> - `log.log_id` is taken for every record that projects as a log event ([0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §6.1), which includes the records of the tenant's `actors` partition, and for every record in the tenant's log partition, written to header field 8 and `log.record.logid`.

### A58. Surrogates are allocated under an advisory lock

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §6
- **Summary:** Surrogates are allocated in the appending transaction under an advisory lock on `(keyed_type, key)`, with the mapping record that binds the surrogate to its key appended in the same transaction as the first record that uses it; bulk jobs reserve surrogate blocks as they reserve entity ID blocks; a mapping is erased only when no live record in any partition is keyed to the surrogate. The ledger's verb is amends; §6's chapter text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §2.3) named the `log."instance.{type}_surrogate"` sequences and said nothing the rule contradicts, so this entry extends. (REVIEW G29)

### A59. Derivations naming a foreign subject are an overlay trigger

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §5
- **Summary:** A derivation that names a foreign subject is an overlay trigger, found by composition through `view.derivation_subject`: a tenant whose derivation names `WDQ123` gets its own `(tenant, id)` row for it, beside local assertions, cluster links and corrections as the things that make an overlay. The derived statement ID hashes the match key, never the resolved subject, so a later `same-as` changes no statement ID and orphans no correction. (REVIEW G34)

### A60. `view.actor` gains `editcount` and `created_at`; `pending` is OAuth-only

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §5.4
- **Summary:** `view.actor` gains `editcount` and `created_at`, maintained by the activity projection from the account's local `edit` rows, erased rows included and job rows excluded, and the implicit `autoconfirmed` group is computed from them; the status value `pending` is one that an OAuth-created subsidiary alone takes. The ledger's verb is corrects; §5.4's chapter text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.5) listed `pending` among the status values without saying who sets it and had no `editcount`, so nothing is contradicted and this entry extends. (REVIEW G40)

### A61. `view.entity_history` backs a mirrored entity's history

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §5.1; amends §5.5
- **Summary:** `view.entity_history (tenant, canonical_id, time, partition, offset, kind, member)` is the one backing of a mirrored entity's history, written by composition with one row per mirror record and per relevant upstream log event of every member of the cluster, so a history page is one keyset query bounded by the entity's own record count; upstream log events are rows of it and never of `view.activity`, which grows with local activity and jobs only; a watched mirrored entity's sync rows are read from it. The default mirrored provider log is `delete/*` and `protect/*`, the backfill covers held entities only, and `create/create` is derived from the first upstream revision. (REVIEW G42)

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.6, as it stood):

> It grows with local activity and the number of jobs, never with the mirrors: a sync of a million entities is one `job` row and one activity row, and per-entity mirror history is served from `entity_source` and the record itself.
>
> Sync rows for a watched mirrored entity are read per target from its mirror records, as a history reads them.

### A62. Dumps from a replica, and the embedded backend's ceiling

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** amends §11
- **Summary:** Dumps are taken from a replica under `pg_export_snapshot()` with parallel workers sharing the snapshot; the embedded query backend is the small profile's and is refused above a configured triple count (`query.embedded_max_triples`); the Wikidata profile requires `query.backend = remote`; `term_prefix` is kept as schema and never created or read by the large profile. (REVIEW G49)

Replaced text ([22](../architecture/22-crates-and-stack.md) §6, as it stood):

### A63. The projection order is a partial order over registered projections

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §7
- **Summary:** The projection order of §7 is a partial order over the projections a build registers, with `ops.projection_state` rows for those only; chapter 22 §3.1 names the milestone's crate and projection set, and the build order puts `scatter-log-postgres` before the file backend and its conformance suite. (REVIEW G52)
