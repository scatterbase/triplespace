# 0008. Namespaces and document pages

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Updated:** 2026-10-29 (A47)
- **Author:** James Hare / Claude Opus
- **Changes:** [0005](0005-crate-organization.md), [0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md)
- **Uses:** [0000](0000-init.md), [0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md), [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md), [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md), [0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md), [0007](0007-actor-identity.md), [0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md), [MediaWiki API contract](../api/mediawiki-compat.md)

## Context

Triplespace's user experience is organized like MediaWiki's, because the goal is an experience compatible with Wikibase. MediaWiki organizes everything into **namespaces**. A page title such as `Item:Q6` names a namespace (`Item`) and a title within it (`Q6`). Namespace IDs, names and page titles appear throughout the API (`ns`, `title`, `pageid`), and clients such as Pywikibot read the namespace list from `meta=siteinfo` ([mediawiki-compat.md §4.0](../api/mediawiki-compat.md); the reference install's list is in `snapshots/mw-1.43.9-wb-REL1_43.siteinfo.json`).

In Wikibase every namespace holds documents: an item is a page whose content is its JSON serialization. In Triplespace that is no longer true:

- **Entity pages are composed views.** `Item:Q6` is a local item and `Property:WDP31` is a property mirrored from Wikidata. Neither is stored as a document. Each is a view over the resolved graph ([0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §3).
- **Some pages really are documents.** An instance needs project pages (policies, documentation, help) and user pages, stored as text with revision history, as MediaWiki stores them. The first content to be moved in comes from project pages on Librarybase and similar Wikibase installs.

Scatterbase has the same split. It stores a **blob**, a sequence of arbitrary bytes, and leaves it to a **view** to decide what the bytes mean.

The goal is not to reimplement MediaWiki's page features. Templates, parser functions, Lua and categories are out of scope. Pages need basic markup and a choice of content model.

### 12. API surface

*Current text: [18](../architecture/18-api.md) §1.1, §2.1, §8.*

## Consequences

- **Two kinds of page share one title space.** Links, redirects, backlinks and search behave the same whether a title names a view or a document.
- **Renaming a user touches only titles.** Page records and revisions are keyed by page ID and actor key, so nothing else has to be rewritten.
- **Old usernames stop working as links.** Links to `User:OldName` in page text break after a rename. That is the cost of not keeping erasable names in redirects.
- ~~**Imported pages need a flattening pass.** Pages that depend heavily on templates can lose layout when they are expanded into static text.~~ *Only on a tenant that does not expand templates (A12).*
- ~~**Most of MediaWiki's page machinery stays out.** No templates, categories, transclusion or Lua. Content that needs them has to be rewritten.~~ *No longer holds. Categories are implemented (A9). Templates, transclusion (A12) and Lua (A13) are available to a tenant that turns them on.*
- **Two new content model IDs.** `markdown` and `yaml` are not MediaWiki models. MediaWiki clients see them as unknown models and can only read or write the raw text.
- ~~**Global revision IDs become urgent.** MediaWiki's `revid`, `oldid` and `lastrevid` come from one sequence shared by every page. Page edits and entity changes now both appear in `list=recentchanges`, so they need one sequence (open questions).~~ *Met by [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §6 and [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2 (Q1).*

## Open questions

- **Q1.** ~~**Global revision IDs.** Log offsets are numbered per partition, but MediaWiki revision IDs are global. Either a global allocator issues revision IDs across partitions, or the API maps (partition, offset) pairs onto one sequence. This was already latent in [0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md) and [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md).~~ *Settled by [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §6 and [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2: one sequence per tenant for revisions and one for log events, taken in the appending transaction and written into the header; mirror records take provider-ranged IDs.*
- **Q2.** ~~**Page IDs for entity views.** `wbgetentities` with `props=info` returns a `pageid`, and a composed view has none. The options are minting one the first time an entity is written to, or returning none and accepting that some clients break.~~ *Settled by [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §6 and [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2: a page ID is taken from the one sequence the first time a key is written in any partition and carried forward in header field 9, so entity views and document pages share one `pageid` space.* *Extended by A35: the sequence is the tenant's own and serves local pages and local entities below 2^40; a mirrored entity's page ID is provider-ranged and computed by the writer, so the two still share one `pageid` space per tenant without an allocation.*
- **Q3.** ~~**The main namespace.** Whether namespace 0 stays empty, becomes a document namespace, or hosts items as it does on Wikidata.~~ *Settled by A6: reserved and empty, like every namespace MediaWiki or Wikibase uses; its talk namespace is not enabled.* *Changed by [0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §8 (A9): a `pages` namespace for articles, with Talk (1) enabled.*
- **Q4.** ~~**Discussions.** Talk namespaces are reserved (§2). How discussions work is its own ADR.~~ *Settled by [0019](0019-discussions.md): talk namespaces are composite views over threads, and a thread is a page in the `Thread` namespace.*
- **Q5.** ~~**Categories.** Whether category links should ever become data, for example as statements or as a list projection.~~ *Settled by [0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §3 and §5: categories are defined only in wikitext and projected as a list; configured mappings turn membership into page statements.*
- **Q6.** ~~**Page protection and permissions.** Who may create, move, delete and protect pages, beyond the owner rule in §6.~~ *Settled by [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §5 (who) and [0023](0023-moderation.md) §1–4 (what protection and deletion are: ACLs on the page).*
- **Q7.** ~~**Search.** Whether one search index covers entity labels and page text together, as `list=search` would expect.~~ *Settled by [0014](0014-caches-and-search.md) §7: two indexes (`entities`, `pages`), one query, with a Postgres fallback (§8).*
- **Q8.** ~~**Page redirects.** Whether document pages may be redirects (`#REDIRECT [[…]]`), and whether a move leaves one for `Project` pages, where no erasable names are involved.~~ *Settled by [0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §1 and §3: a `wikitext` page whose text begins with a redirect line is a redirect, and a move leaves one everywhere except user renames and thread renames.*

## Amendment log

### A1. The crate table moves to 0005

- **Date:** 2026-09-26
- **Source:** [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §2, revision of 2026-09-26
- **Change:** supersedes §11
- **Summary:** 0005 §2 became the one crate table CI checks. `scatter-markdown` was folded into `scatter-pages` as a feature, and `scatter-keyed` into `scatter-normalize`.

Replaced text (§11):

> | Layer | Crate | Contents | Depends on |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | Substrate | `scatter-pages` | Page records and their operations, page IDs, the content-model trait, validation for `json`, `yaml` and `text` | — |
> | | `scatter-wikitext` | Parsing and rendering the §8 subset. The link resolver is passed in as a trait | — |
> | | `scatter-markdown` | Rendering for `markdown`, as a thin wrapper around an existing CommonMark crate | — |
> | Triplespace | `triplespace-titles` | The namespace registry, title normalization and the title resolver (§1–3) | `scatter-pages`, `scatter-wikibase-model`, `scatter-identity`, `scatter-keyed` |
>
> - `scatter-pages`, `scatter-wikitext` and `scatter-markdown` are pure, under [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §3 rule 2.
> - `scatter-wikitext` and `scatter-markdown` must build for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`, like `scatter-wikibase-shape`, so the editor's preview runs the same code as the server.
> - The namespace registry is in the surfaces layer because namespaces are part of the MediaWiki compatibility surface. Scatterbase does not need them.

### A2. Entity IDs canonicalize by their grammar

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** [0017](0017-entity-id-grammar.md) §2
- **Change:** amends §3
- **Summary:** The `entity-id` normalizer uppercases only the prefix and applies the type's ID grammar to the rest, so case-sensitive UUID IDs survive. Until the migration, nothing in this ADR recorded the change. 0017's header attributed it to 0017 §4, but the text is in 0017 §2.

Replaced text (§3):

> - `entity-id`: parses and uppercases an entity ID, so `Item:q42` becomes `Item:Q42`.

### A3. Discussions

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** [0019](0019-discussions.md) §2, §3, §5
- **Change:** amends §2; extends §1, §3, §5, §8, §10
- **Summary:** Talk namespaces are now of kind `composite`: the talk page of a subject is the set of threads attached to it. Threads themselves are pages in a new `Thread` namespace of kind `thread`, whose number is pending registration.
  Not noted here before the migration: 0019 §3 and §5 also gave threads minted titles, gave the `markdown` model wiki links and HTML sanitized to §8's allow-list, and made links in posts `page_link` rows. A11 later replaced the `composite` and `thread` kinds with models.

Replaced text (§2):

> **Talk namespaces are reserved, not implemented.** Their IDs are allocated and listed, because MediaWiki clients assume every subject namespace has a talk namespace at the next odd number. They hold no pages. How discussions work is left to its own ADR.

### A4. Deletion becomes an ACL

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** [0023](0023-moderation.md) §4
- **Change:** amends §4
- **Summary:** `delete` and `undelete` are no longer page operations. Deletion is a `read` ACL on the page, written to the tenant `log` partition, and undeletion retires it; the effects described here are unchanged. The `page` payload type carries `create`, `edit` and `move` only.

Replaced text (§4):

> | `delete` | Hides the page and its history from everyone but administrators. This is hiding in the sense of [0006](0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) (Context), not erasure |
> | `undelete` | Reverses a `delete` |

> A base is required for `edit`, `move` and `delete`.

> | **Pages** | `{base}/graph/pages` | Source | Page edits, moves, deletions and imports | Full | `logged` | Public |

### A5. The `resolver` kind

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** [0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §1, §3
- **Summary:** A `resolver` namespace holds no pages and no records. Every title in it is a key, normalized by the resolver's normalizer, and viewing the title performs a lookup. Its talk number is `reserved`. Before the migration this was recorded only in this ADR's header.

### A6. Numbering policy

- **Date:** 2026-09-27
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-09-26/27
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Three rules replace the sentence below and settle the main-namespace question (Q3):
  1. **Every number MediaWiki core or any Wikibase extension uses is reserved.** It is listed in `docs/registry/namespaces.toml` with kind `reserved`, is never given another meaning, and is not implemented unless an ADR says so. The reserved set: Media (−2), the main namespace (0), File (6), MediaWiki (8), Template (10), Help (12), Category (14), Query (124) and Lexeme (146). The main namespace stays reserved and empty; help content goes in `Project` as before.
  2. **Talk namespaces exist only for implemented subject namespaces.** They work as §2 and [0019](0019-discussions.md) §2 describe, at the next odd number, and are `composite`. A reserved-and-not-implemented namespace has no talk namespace enabled: Talk (1), File talk (7) and the rest are not registered.
  3. **Triplespace's own namespaces take 210–219, and resolver prefixes ([0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md)) take 220–229.** Allocated now: Domain 210/211 ([0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §11), Keyword 212/213 ([0017](0017-entity-id-grammar.md) §5), Thread 214/215 ([0019](0019-discussions.md) §3), OSM 216/217 ([0036](0036-openstreetmap-providers.md) §3), DOI 220/221 and URL 222/223 ([0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md)). The ranges are registered on mediawiki.org's Extension default namespaces page, which as of 2026-09-27 lists nothing between 204 and 240. Allocation is a change to `namespaces.toml`, under the registry's rules ([0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §5).

Replaced text (§2):

> Media (−2), File (6), MediaWiki (8), Template (10), Help (12) and Category (14) are not registered. Help content goes in `Project`.

### A7. Adopted wikis keep page IDs

- **Date:** 2026-09-28
- **Source:** [0035](0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) §4
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** When the source is the wiki the tenant adopted, imported pages keep their source page IDs, supplied in header field 9 as adopted entities' are, and the page-ID floor set at adoption already covers them.

### A8. OSM namespaces

- **Date:** 2026-09-28
- **Source:** [0036](0036-openstreetmap-providers.md) §3
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** OSM and OSM talk were allocated 216/217. A18 renamed them.

### A9. Articles, categories and page statements

- **Date:** 2026-09-29
- **Source:** [0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §1, §3, §4, §8, §11
- **Change:** amends §2, §4, §8, §10
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §2: Two reserved numbers are implemented, as rule 1 allows. The main namespace (0) is a `document` namespace for articles, with Talk (1) enabled; an unprefixed title in a link is a main-namespace title, and entities are linked with their namespace. Category (14) is a `document` namespace for category description pages, `wikitext` only, with Category talk (15) enabled.
  - §4: A page's statements are change sets (`scatter:v0/changeset`) keyed by its page ID in the same partition, restricted to statements. They take revision IDs, so a page's history interleaves text and statement revisions.
  - §8: Category links in the latest revision of a `wikitext` page define its category membership, a projection like MediaWiki's `categorylinks`; `{{DEFAULTSORT:…}}` and `__HIDDENCAT__` are recognised; `[[:Category:…]]` is a plain link. The foot of the page lists categories as links to their pages in the `Category` namespace, with hidden categories collapsed.
  - §10: A page's statements go into the main graph with the page's document node as subject. Page text and category membership are still not RDF.

Replaced text (§2, from A6 rule 1):

> The main namespace stays reserved and empty; help content goes in `Project` as before.

Replaced text (§4):

> The partition holds page records, not quads. Its only RDF output is revision metadata (§10).

Replaced text (§8 and §10):

> - Category links (`[[Category:…]]`) are listed as plain text at the foot of the page. No category pages exist.

> - Nothing about document pages goes into the main or resolved graph. Page text is not RDF.

### A10. Files and media

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0039](0039-files-and-media.md) §1, §13, §14
- **Change:** extends §1, §2, §3, §8, §9
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §2: Three more reserved numbers are implemented: File (6) is a `file` namespace, a document namespace whose pages may also carry uploads, with File talk (7) enabled; Media (−2) is `virtual` and resolves to a file's current bytes.
  - §8: The subset gains file embedding (`[[File:…]]` with MediaWiki's options and a caption), `[[:File:…]]` links to description pages, `[[Media:…]]` links to bytes, and `<gallery>`. External image URLs are never embedded.
  - §9: Exports with `<upload>` elements import file versions, and `triplespace-cli files import` imports a directory as `importImages.php` does.
  - Not noted here before the migration: the `file` kind in §1, which A11 replaced with `pages` and `uploads = true`, and the `file-name` normalizer in §3.

### A11. Namespaces name models, not kinds

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0041](0041-content-models.md) §1–5
- **Change:** amends §1, §3, §5
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §1: Every page has a content model, and a namespace entry names its allowed models and default model. The kind now says only whether the namespace holds pages: `pages`, `reserved`, `virtual` or `resolver`. Entity views, document pages, file pages, threads and talk pages are all `pages` namespaces; what they are made of is their model (`wikibase-item`, `wikitext`, `triplespace-thread`, `triplespace-talk` and so on), and a File namespace adds the `uploads` flag. `entity_types` leaves the entry, since the model names the entity type.
  - §5: Content models now cover every page, not only document pages, and live in `docs/registry/content-models.toml`. IDs follow one rule: MediaWiki's and Wikibase extensions' IDs are kept and reserved, generic formats (`markdown`, `yaml`) take no prefix, and models unique to Triplespace take `triplespace-`. Each model has a **source** (text, entity, thread, composite or statements); only text models support direct editing, and `changecontentmodel` moves only between text models the namespace allows.
  - Not noted here before the migration: the resolve step of §3 named document namespaces, a kind this entry retires.

Replaced text (§1):

> - the **kind**, one of:
>   - **entity view**: pages are composed from the resolved graph. The entry names the entity types the namespace hosts;
>   - **document**: pages are stored text with a content model (§5). The entry names the allowed content models and the default;
>   - **reserved**: the namespace is listed in `meta=siteinfo` but holds no pages;
>   - **virtual**: pages are generated by the server (`Special`);

Replaced text (§3):

> - in a document namespace, to a page ID (§4).

Replaced text (§5):

> A document page has one **content model**, which decides how its text is validated and rendered.

> **Content models are registry data.** The rendering code for each model implements a trait in `scatter-pages` (§11), so an instance can add models without changing the page format.

### A12. Template expansion

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0042](0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §1, §3, §7–9, §13
- **Change:** amends §8, §9; extends §2, §10
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §2: A reserved number can be implemented conditionally, by a setting named in its `namespaces.toml` entry (`enabled_by`). Template (10), with Template talk (11), is a `pages` namespace while the tenant's `wikitext.expansion` is on; Module (828) and Module talk (829), Scribunto's numbers, now registered, while `wikitext.lua` is on. Turning a setting off keeps the namespace's pages readable and refuses writes with `ts-namespace-disabled`.
  - §8: Rendering has two stages. With the tenant's `wikitext.expansion` on, templates, parser functions and variables are expanded natively first, and the subset renders the expanded text; a tenant may instead render through Parsoid (0042 §8). With expansion off, template calls stay chips, as above.
  - §9: With expansion on, step 3 is optional: the census also reports which templates and modules the export contains, and the importer may bring Template and Module pages with their history instead of flattening.
  - §10: With expansion on, the links projection reads the expanded text, so links that templates emit count, and its rows are written by the refresh job of 0042 §10.

Replaced text (§8):

> - Template calls (`{{…}}`) and parser functions render as a visible placeholder showing the call.

Replaced text (§9):

> 3. **Flatten templates in one extra revision.** Where the latest revision uses templates, a bot fetches the expanded text from the source wiki with `action=expandtemplates` and saves it as a new revision. History stays faithful to the source, and the current text needs no template engine.

### A13. Lua modules

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0043](0043-lua-modules.md) §2–3
- **Change:** amends §5; extends §2
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §2: A reserved number can be implemented conditionally, by a setting named in its `namespaces.toml` entry (`enabled_by`). Template (10), with Template talk (11), is a `pages` namespace while the tenant's `wikitext.expansion` is on; Module (828) and Module talk (829), Scribunto's numbers, now registered, while `wikitext.lua` is on. Turning a setting off keeps the namespace's pages readable and refuses writes with `ts-namespace-disabled`.
  - §5: The exclusion above is of models that reach the reader's browser. `Scribunto`, whose modules run on the server in a sandbox and return wikitext, is implemented; `css`, `javascript` and `sanitized-css` stay excluded.

Replaced text (§5):

> - **Executable models are not supported.** `css`, `javascript` and `sanitized-css` are not registered. User-supplied scripts and styles are an injection risk that nothing on the roadmap needs.

### A14. Tenant-relative IDs in titles

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0044](0044-tenant-relative-ids.md) §5
- **Change:** extends §3
- **Summary:** The `entity-id` normalizer accepts tenant-relative IDs: `Item:QQQ5` normalizes to `Item:Q5`.

### A15. Table namespaces

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0045](0045-table-content-model.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** Table (218) and Table talk (219), the last free pair in 210–219. Table pages hold `triplespace-table` definitions, with `wikitext` for `/doc` subpages as in Module.

### A16. Import and export forms

- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Source:** [0047](0047-special-pages.md) §8
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** `Special:Import` is the form that starts this job, after showing the census. `Special:Export` writes MediaWiki XML of pages and local entities, the counterpart of this import, and a verifiable `records` format.

### A17. Second ranges

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-01
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** Rule 3 gains a second block for each purpose, because 210–219 is full and 220–229 has three pairs left. Triplespace's own namespaces continue in **310–319**, and resolver prefixes in **320–329**. A first block is used up before its second: the next resolver takes 224. Nothing is allocated in either new block yet. James checked mediawiki.org's Extension default namespaces page on 2026-10-01 and found nothing registered in 310–329; both blocks are filed together with 210–229.

### A18. Notation namespaces

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0048](0048-notation.md) §7
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** 216 and 217 are renamed from OSM and OSM talk to Notation and Notation talk. They hold the same pages, OSM keys and tags, now as notations in the `osm` scheme (`Notation:osm:amenity=cafe`), and will hold other schemes' notations as schemes are added.

Replaced text: the names OSM and OSM talk for 216/217, in A6 rule 3 and A8.

### A19. Boards, and talk namespaces that forward

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0049](0049-boards.md) §2
- **Change:** amends §2; extends §1, §3
- **Summary:** As noted under each section before the migration:
  - §2: Board (310) and Board talk (311), the first pair of the second block. Board talk is `virtual` and **forwards** to Board: every title in it resolves to the same title in 310, because a board is its own talk page. Thread talk (215) changes from `reserved` to forwarding to Thread (214) for the same reason.
  - §3: A `virtual` namespace with `forwards_to` resolves every title to the same title in the namespace it names, as a permanent redirect: `Board talk:X` to `Board:X`, `Thread talk:X` to `Thread:X`. Forwarding titles have no page IDs.

Replaced text: Thread talk (215) as `reserved` and empty, from [0019](0019-discussions.md) §3 (A3).

### A20. Consolidated under 0050

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §13
- **Change:** consolidates §1–5, §8–11
- **Summary:** A1–A19 were folded into the Decision text, the open questions were numbered, and falsified consequences were struck. No decision changed. Before this, the amendments were blockquotes under the sections they changed, which A3–A19 now quote, and A2, A5 and A8 were recorded only in other ADRs. The file before consolidation is commit `dc4774a`.

Replaced text (§2). The table as it stood, with rows 1, 210 and 211 already edited in place:

> | ID | Canonical name | Kind | Notes |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | −1 | Special | Virtual | `Special:EntityData`, `Special:EntityPage`, `Special:Redirect` and the other special pages the API contract needs |
> | 0 | (main) | Reserved | MediaWiki requires it to exist. Its use is open |
> | 1 | Talk | Not enabled | The main namespace is reserved and not implemented (amendment below) |
> | 2 | User | Document | §6 |
> | 3 | User talk | Reserved | |
> | 4 | Project | Document | §7 |
> | 5 | Project talk | Reserved | |
> | 120 | Item | Entity view | Wikibase's default number |
> | 121 | Item talk | Reserved | |
> | 122 | Property | Entity view | Wikibase's default number |
> | 123 | Property talk | Reserved | |
> | 210 | Domain | Entity view | [0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md); number allocated 2026-09-27 (amendment below) |
> | 211 | Domain talk | Composite | |

### A21. Page redirects

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §1–3, §5
- **Change:** amends §4; extends §3, §8, §10
- **Summary:** A `wikitext` page whose text begins with `#REDIRECT [[Target]]` is a redirect; the resolver follows one hop unless told `redirect=no`; a move leaves a redirect page at the old title by default, so a move is one record on the moved page and a `create` of a second; links to redirects carry `mw-redirect`; the links projection records a redirect's target. Q8 settled.

Replaced text (§4):

> - **A move is one record.** Moving a page appends a record with its new title, and nothing else changes.

### A22. Page repositories and title inheritance

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0052](0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §3–4
- **Change:** amends §3; extends §8, §10
- **Summary:** A `pages` title resolves to the primary of its stack: the local page, else the first page repository in `pages.repos` that serves the namespace and has the title. Links to inherited titles are ordinary links carrying `ts-inherited`; links into namespaces no repository serves leave the wiki; the links projection records links to inherited titles by title.

Replaced text (§3):

> - in any other `pages` namespace, to a page ID (§4).

### A23. Forks, and talk pages imported as threads

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0054](0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §1, §5
- **Change:** extends §4, §9
- **Summary:** A `create` may carry `forked_from`, naming the repository, page and revision a fork was taken from. A wikitext talk page in an import is converted into closed threads on the subject's talk page, split by level-two heading.

### A24. `sanitized-css` is supported

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §1
- **Change:** amends §5
- **Summary:** The exclusion of style models is narrowed to `css` and `javascript`, which reach the browser as written. `sanitized-css`, TemplateStyles' model, is implemented behind a sanitizer that scopes every sheet to rendered content.

Replaced text (§5):

> - **Models whose code reaches the reader's browser are not supported.** `css`, `javascript` and `sanitized-css` are not registered. User-supplied scripts and styles are an injection risk that nothing on the roadmap needs. `Scribunto`, whose modules run on the server in a sandbox and return wikitext, is supported while a tenant has Lua on ([0043](0043-lua-modules.md) §3).

### A25. Scope

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0060](0060-scopes.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** Scope (312) and Scope talk (313), the second pair of the 310–319 block, with the `/doc` rule of Table.

### A26. Sprints in Project

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0061](0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** `Project` (4) allows `triplespace-sprint`, for subpages only; the default stays `wikitext`.

Replaced text (§2, the Project row):

> | 4, 5 | Project, Project talk | `pages` | `wikitext` | §7 |

### A27. Query

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0063](0063-query-namespace.md) §2
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Query (124) moves from `reserved` to `pages` with model `triplespace-sparql`, keeping Wikibase's meaning for the number; Query talk (125) is added.

Replaced text (§2):

> | 124 | Query | `reserved` | — | Rule 1 |

### A28. EntitySchema

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0064](0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** EntitySchema (640) and EntitySchema talk (641), the extension's numbers, hosting the `entityschema` entity type.

### A29. Lexeme

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0066](0066-lexemes.md) §2
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Lexeme (146) moves from `reserved` to `pages` with model `wikibase-lexeme`; Lexeme talk (147) is added.

Replaced text (§2):

> | 146 | Lexeme | `reserved` | — | Rule 1 |

### A30. The `follow` operation

- **Date:** 2026-10-06
- **Source:** [0069](0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §7
- **Change:** extends §4
- **Summary:** A fork's page records gain `follow`, a null revision recording whether the fork's talk page follows the repository's or has been forked.

### A31. A tenant range, and entity-source namespaces

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** [0078](0078-entity-sources.md) §5
- **Change:** extends §2, §3
- **Summary:** Rule 4: a tenant's own namespaces take 3000 and above, or 100–199 except registered numbers, and an adopted wiki keeps its numbers; other numbers are refused with `ts-namespace-number`, and names that equal another namespace's or an interwiki prefix with `ts-namespace-name-taken`. Until now nothing said which numbers a tenant's namespaces may take. An entity source's namespace is a `resolver` namespace with the source's ID normalizer and the source's lookup.

Replaced text (§2):

> MediaWiki's canonical numbers are kept wherever a namespace has one, because clients hard-code them. Three rules govern every other number (A6, A17):

### A32. `triplespace-sprint` is allowed, not default, on Project subpages

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §2
- **Summary:** In the Project row of §2's table, `triplespace-sprint` is a model *allowed* on Project subpages; the default model of a Project subpage stays `wikitext`, as [0061](0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §2 says. The row read as though subpages defaulted to the sprint model. (PENDING E12)

Replaced text (§2):

> | 4, 5 | Project, Project talk | `pages` | `wikitext`; `triplespace-sprint` on subpages | §7; [0061](0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §2 |

### A33. Current text relocated to the architecture chapters

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §14
- **Change:** relocates §1, §2, §3, §4, §5, §6, §7, §8, §9, §10, §12
- **Summary:** The Decision's current text now lives in the architecture chapters [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md), [18](../architecture/18-api.md), in the sections each pointer names; this ADR keeps its headings, provenance lines, Context, Consequences, Open questions and this log. The last commit in which this file carried the text is `c76d96f`. No decision changed.

### A34. Revision states per page record; one writer per row class of the links projection

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0083](0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §4, §6
- **Change:** extends §4; amends §10
- **Summary:** The state after every revision of a page is stored once, per revision: the appending transaction writes the page's state after each `pages` record, the text and the fold of its statement change sets, to `view.entity_revision (tenant, revid, state)`, beside the current state in `view.graph_state`, so that `oldid=`, `action=compare`, `Special:PermanentLink` and export read one row rather than folding the page's history (§4). The rows of the links projection (§10) have two classes and one writer each: every row of `view.page_link` carries `from_render`; the page projection writes the source-derived rows when it applies the record, and the refresh job writes the expansion-derived rows with `from_render = true`; each writer owns its class, readers union the two, the refresh job never deletes a row it did not write, and turning `wikitext.expansion` off truncates the render-owned rows and nothing else. The same holds for `view.page_category` and `view.page_prop` ([0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §2, [0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6). 0083's table did not list this ADR; the chapter cites 0083 §4 at [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.2 and §6 at §5.2, and the table was extended. (REVIEW G11, G13)

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §5.2, as it stood):

> On a tenant with expansion on, the projection reads the expanded text, so links that templates emit count, and its rows are written by the refresh job of [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10.

### A35. Page IDs are per tenant; a mirrored entity's page ID is provider-ranged

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** amends §4
- **Summary:** Page IDs are per tenant: a tenant's own pages take IDs from the tenant's own sequence, which starts at 1, stays below 2^40 and never reuses a number, and `view.entity`'s unique key on a page ID is `(tenant, page_id)`. A mirrored entity's page ID is provider-ranged, `provider_number << 40 | upstream page ID` where the provider publishes one and `provider_number << 40 | mirror offset` otherwise, computed by the writer with no allocation; `log."instance.page_id"` is not used for entities. A page served by a page repository takes a provider-ranged page ID the same way. "Minted by the instance in sequence" is withdrawn. The ledger named §3 (titles); the chapter states page identity at [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.1, whose provenance is §4, and the ledger row was corrected. (REVIEW G18)

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.1, as it stood):

> **A page is identified by a page ID, not by its title.** Page IDs are minted by the instance in sequence, start at 1 and are never reused. The title is an attribute of the page, in the same way a username is an attribute of an actor ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §4; [07](../architecture/07-actors-and-accounts.md)). This has three effects:

### A36. A move leaves a redirect only where the old title may hold `wikitext`

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** corrects §4
- **Summary:** A move leaves a redirect at the old title only where the old title may hold `wikitext`, since only a `wikitext` page can be a redirect: in namespace 0, User, Project, File, Template and Category, and at the `/doc` titles of Module, Table, Query and Scope. Where the old title cannot hold `wikitext`, the move behaves as `noredirect` without needing `suppressredirect`, and the `move/move` event says so with `noredirect: true`. Entity, keyed-type, Thread and Board namespaces disallow `move` altogether; a thread's title follows its subject through the thread's own `rename` record, which is not a move. The ledger named §3; the fold is at [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §2.5, whose provenance is §4 here beside [0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §3, and the ledger row was corrected. (REVIEW G43)

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §2.5, as it stood):

> **A move is one record on the moved page.** Moving a page appends a `move` record with its new title, and nothing else about that page changes. **A move leaves a redirect at the old title by default,** as MediaWiki's does. `action=move` and the Move form append, in one transaction with one base check:

> - **Thread renames leave none** ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §3), for the reason user renames do.

### A37. The Project namespace's local name follows the site's name, and keeps the old one

- **Date:** 2026-10-17
- **Source:** [0085](0085-settings-and-preferences.md) §7
- **Change:** amends §7
- **Summary:** The local name of the Project namespace is `site.name` unless the tenant's `namespace` record fixes it. When the site is renamed and the local name followed it, the old name becomes an alias of the namespace in the same change set, so links through it still resolve; a fixed local name, `Project` included, is untouched and gains no alias, as James decided: an old project name is kept only if it was the namespace's name. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.5.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.5, as it stood):

> - **The canonical name is `Project`, and the local name is the site name,** as in MediaWiki. On the reference install that is `Triplespace Ref` ([siteinfo snapshot](../api/snapshots/mw-1.43.9-wb-REL1_43.siteinfo.json)). Both resolve.

### A38. An adopted wiki's pages come in its adoption job

- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Source:** [0035](0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) A13
- **Change:** amends §9
- **Summary:** When the source is the wiki the tenant adopted, its pages are imported within the adoption job, not by a job of their own. They keep their source page IDs in field 9 and, revision by revision, their source revision IDs in field 7, so that an `oldid` link into the source's pages resolves as one into its entities does, and a revision the source hid is imported as an adopted entity revision is. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6, as it stood):

> **Page IDs on an adopted wiki.** When the source is the wiki the tenant adopted, imported pages keep their source page IDs, supplied in header field 9 as adopted entities' are, and the page-ID floor set at adoption already covers them ([0035](../decisions/0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) §4; [08](../architecture/08-tenants-and-instances.md)).

### A39. Inline HTML follows MediaWiki's Sanitizer allow-list

- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-10-19
- **Change:** amends §8
- **Summary:** MediaWiki's Sanitizer is the authority for the HTML wikitext may write: its allow-list of tags, the attributes each tag keeps (the common set of `id`, `class`, `style`, `lang`, `dir`, `title`, ARIA, RDFa and microdata attributes and `data-*`, plus each tag's own, such as `colspan` on cells and `start` on lists), and its check of `style`. The subset's row had listed only `class`, `id` and a sanitized `style`; [11](../architecture/11-rendering-templates-and-modules.md) §1.2 already named the Sanitizer, and the built-in renderer implements it. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §5.1.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §5.1, as it stood):

> | Safe inline HTML | An allow-list of formatting tags, such as `<br>`, `<span>`, `<div>`, `<sup>` and `<sub>`, with attributes restricted to `class`, `id` and a sanitized `style` |

### A40. The edit base is MediaWiki's

- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-10-19
- **Change:** amends §4
- **Summary:** An `edit` of a document page takes its base as MediaWiki's `action=edit` does: from `baserevid`, else from `basetimestamp`, read as the page's latest record at that time, else the page's latest record, so a client that sends neither edits whatever is current instead of being refused. A stale base is `editconflict`; `createonly` on an existing page is `articleexists`, and `nocreate` on a missing one `missingtitle`. A base remains required for `move`. Clients written for MediaWiki (Pywikibot, mwclient, the site's own edit form) send `baserevid` or `basetimestamp`, so the change loses no conflict a client was asking to have detected. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.2.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §3.2, as it stood):

> **Edit conflicts use the base offset** ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §8). An `edit` carries the offset of the page's latest record that the client saw. A mismatch is reported as `editconflict`. A base is required for `edit` and `move`.

### A41. An adopted wiki's templates come as pages; its talk pages wait for threads

- **Date:** 2026-10-19
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-10-19
- **Change:** amends §9
- **Summary:** Adoption brings the adopted wiki's Template pages as ordinary pages with their history, whatever the tenant's `wikitext.expansion`, rather than flattening templates into an extra revision: while expansion is off the pages stay readable and nothing transcludes them ([11](../architecture/11-rendering-templates-and-modules.md) §1.3), and a tenant that wants them rendered turns expansion on, as Librarybase does. Talk pages, which become threads, are not imported until that conversion exists; they and pages in reserved namespaces are counted `deferred` in the adoption's report. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6.

Replaced text: none; the two sentences are added to [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6's paragraph on an adopted wiki.

### A42. Page links are recorded by title

- **Date:** 2026-10-20
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of 2026-10-20
- **Change:** corrects §10
- **Summary:** The links projection records a link to a page by the target's namespace number and title, never by page ID, whether or not a page has the title, as MediaWiki's `pagelinks` does: `view.page_link` rows of `target_kind` 6 (`TITLE`) with `target_id` `{ns}:{title}`. A link to an entity is recorded by its ID (`target_kind` 1). So creating a page needs no rewrite of the links to it, and a move leaves links on the old title, which its redirect serves. §10's "after resolution" and the backlink sentences read as if links to existing pages were held by page ID, and chapter 03 kept `page_link` targets current through title-index maintenance; neither was the design the projection implements. The chapter text is [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §5.2, with the schema comment and the redirect paragraph of [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.5 and §4.7.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §5.2, the paragraph's first sentence, as it stood):

> **A links projection** records every link from a document page to a page or entity, after resolution ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md)).

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.7, as it stood):

> `target_page_id` is refreshed when the target is created, deleted, undeleted or moved, by the same title-index maintenance that keeps `page_link` targets current.

### A43. An adopted wiki's talk pages are converted, comment by comment

- **Date:** 2026-10-20
- **Source:** [0090](0090-converting-talk-pages-comment-by-comment.md) §10
- **Change:** amends §9
- **Summary:** Adoption converts the adopted wiki's talk pages to threads within the job, with their history read from the dump to attribute each comment and their actors the adopted actors, so they are no longer counted `deferred`; talk pages in a content model other than wikitext still are. An imported talk namespace is converted with one post per comment, attributed from the export's own revisions where it carries full history and from signatures otherwise, with the section and page fallbacks. Chapter text: [10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6, as it stood):

> **Its talk pages wait** for their conversion to threads (below), and they and pages in reserved namespaces are counted `deferred` in the job's report ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) A41).

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §6, as it stood):

> **Talk namespaces are converted to threads.** A wikitext talk page in an export is imported as threads homed on its subject's talk page, split by level-two heading with the frontmatter first, each created closed with the `archived` status and holding its section's wikitext as the opening post ([0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §5; [14](../architecture/14-discussions.md)); a project-wide discussion page lands on a board the importer names.

### A44. The Interface namespace

- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Source:** [0095](0095-the-interface-namespace.md) §1
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Namespace 8 holds pages: plain-text interface messages and names of IDs, shown under the local name Interface while keeping the canonical name MediaWiki, with its talk namespace 9 (0095 §1). It is no longer reserved.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §1.4, as it stood):

> | 8 | MediaWiki | `reserved` | — | — | — | Rule 1 |

### A45. Messages from Interface pages

- **Date:** 2026-10-28
- **Source:** [0095](0095-the-interface-namespace.md) §7 (A1)
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** An adopted wiki's MediaWiki-namespace pages come as Interface pages, each revision as `text`; pages of other models are ignored and counted (0095 §7).

### A46. An adopted wiki's namespaces are registered

- **Date:** 2026-10-29
- **Source:** [0096](0096-adopting-any-mediawiki.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §2
- **Summary:** An adopted wiki keeps its namespace numbers through the adoption job, which registers each number the registry does not list as a tenant `namespace` record, with its talk number, and renames or archives into Project one whose name is taken (0096 §2). Rule 4 says so.

### A47. The Help namespace

- **Date:** 2026-10-29
- **Source:** [0096](0096-adopting-any-mediawiki.md) §3
- **Change:** amends §2
- **Summary:** Namespace 12 holds pages: Help, a document namespace that works as Project does, with Help talk at 13 (0096 §3). Its local name does not follow the site name, and it allows neither `triplespace-sprint` nor `sanitized-css`. It is no longer reserved, and help content no longer has to go in Project.

Replaced text ([10](../architecture/10-pages-and-content-models.md) §1.4, as it stood):

> | 12 | Help | `reserved` | — | — | — | Rule 1. Help content goes in `Project` |
