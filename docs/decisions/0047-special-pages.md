# 0047. Special pages

- **Status:** Proposed
- **Date:** 2026-09-30
- **Updated:** 2026-11-08 (A39)
- **Author:** James Hare / Claude Opus
- **Changes:** [0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md), [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md), [0005](0005-crate-organization.md), [0007](0007-actor-identity.md), [0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md), [0010](0010-site-ui.md), [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md), [0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md), [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md), [0018](0018-tenants.md), [0023](0023-moderation.md), [0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md), [0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md), [0031](0031-property-constraints.md), [0042](0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md), [0046](0046-primary-tenant.md)
- **Uses:** [0019](0019-discussions.md), [0021](0021-notifications.md), [0028](0028-tenancy-policy.md), [0034](0034-frontend-stack.md), [0038](0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md), [0039](0039-files-and-media.md), [0040](0040-instance-prerogatives.md)

## Context

About sixty special pages are named across [0001](0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md) to [0046](0046-primary-tenant.md). Each ADR named one where MediaWiki users would look for it: 0010 §12's address table, 0016 §7, 0023 §9, 0028 §11, 0039 §18 and so on. [0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §2 says `triplespace-server` "serves the special pages the ADRs name". That makes the set whatever the ADRs happened to mention, and leaves four problems.

1. **Pages the ADRs rely on but never name.**
   - [0010](0010-site-ui.md) §2 puts a **Special pages** link in the global header, but specifies no index for it.
   - 0010 §3 describes "the full results page" of search without giving it an address.
   - 0010 §2's **New** menu and [0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §3's "Create an item with this DOI" both open an item form that is not specified.
   - Move, revision deletion and unblocking exist as actions ([0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §4, [0023](0023-moderation.md) §8) but have no pages.
   - Identity conflicts are "listed for review" ([0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §10), as are local corrections ([0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §7), but neither list has an address.
2. **Standard pages nobody has decided.** MediaWiki 1.43 core registers 138 special pages, 8 of them conditionally. Wikibase REL1_43 registers 20 in the repository and 3 in the client. Most of them are maintenance reports, which tools, gadgets and help pages link to by name. No ADR says which of them Triplespace serves.
3. **Renamed pages have lost their MediaWiki names.** Some examples:
   - `Special:EditFilter` replaces AbuseFilter's `Special:AbuseFilter` ([0030](0030-edit-filters.md)).
   - `Special:OAuthConsumers` and a section of `Special:Account` replace the OAuth extension's consumer pages ([0025](0025-oauth-server.md) §5).
   - Bot passwords became subsidiaries' keys ([0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §4).

   Only `Special:Preferences` was given a redirect (0010 §11). [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) Consequences promises that "MediaWiki clients and users see MediaWiki", and that promise does not hold at these addresses.
4. **Reports at mirror scale.** MediaWiki computes its expensive reports offline in miser mode (`$wgMiserMode`, `updateSpecialPages.php` into `querycache`). A report over everything an instance holds would include hundreds of millions of mirrored entities. Such a report costs a great deal and tells a wiki's editors little about their own wiki.

Wikibase REL1_43 no longer registers `Special:EntitiesWithoutLabel` or `Special:EntitiesWithoutDescription`, which earlier releases had. Tools still link to them.

James's direction, from the design discussion of 2026-09-30:

- Add the Wikibase compatibility forms.
- Reports are **local graphs only by default**, as the general rule for report pages.
- Reports are **live projections by default**, and otherwise configured as batch.
- Build a **native Special:Nuke** and a **Special:Export**.
- **LinkSearch** stays outstanding until the external-links table is designed.
- **No EmailUser**.
- **Mute** and the **redirect reports** are deferred.
- **Aliases are configured in the registry**.

## Consequences

- **One list answers whether Triplespace has a given special page,** and, where it does not, why not. The checker keeps the ADRs and the list from drifting apart.
- **MediaWiki's names keep working** for renamed pages and for pages folded into `Special:Account`. A help page or tool that links to `Special:AbuseFilter` or `Special:BotPasswords` lands in the right place.
- **Reports describe the wiki, not its mirrors.** A tenant mirroring Wikidata gets `ItemsWithoutSitelinks` for its own items, not for a hundred million of Wikidata's. Mirror-scale reports are possible, but only as configured batch runs.
- **Reports are live without miser mode.** The price is one more projection and some fan-out per link and category change. The instance's `reports` configuration is the escape hatch where a tenant's write rate makes that too costly. Operators can apply it to the whole instance or to one tenant.
- **Nuke is a job, so it is one row, one patrol mark and one undo.** It reaches entities, statements, files and posts as well as pages, and it can go back further than recent changes.
- **Exports can be verified.** The `records` format lets someone who holds an export prove what the wiki held, which suits Scatterbase's purposes as well.
- ~~**Some familiar pages wait on other designs.** `LinkSearch` and `PagesWithProp` wait on tables that 0042 implies but never defines. The redirect reports wait on [0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) Q8.~~ *The redirect reports are served ([0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §6; A3) and `PagesWithProp` is ([0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6; A5). `LinkSearch` still waits on an external-links table.*

## Open questions

- **Q1. The external-links table.** Its shape (MediaWiki's `externallinks` stores reversed domains for prefix search) decides `LinkSearch`, `list=exturlusage`, and edit-filter variables over added links.
- **Q2.** ~~**A page-properties table.** It would serve `PagesWithProp`, `list=pageswithprop` and `prop=pageprops`.~~ *Settled by [0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6: `view.page_prop`.*
- **Q3. Global Nuke.** Whether a global group at the farm base ([0028](0028-tenancy-policy.md) §3) may nuke a farm account across every tenant it is linked to, as one job per tenant or as an instance act ([0040](0040-instance-prerogatives.md)).
- **Q4.** ~~**Page statements in exports.** Whether to carry them in MediaWiki XML as an extra slot, which only Triplespace would read, or only in `records`.~~ *Settled by A32: `records` only; the XML stays a plain MediaWiki export.*
- **Q5. Mute.** Whether `Special:Mute` and user-level muting of notifications ([0021](0021-notifications.md)) and email should exist at all.
- **Q6. Reports over mirror graphs.** Which batch reports over a mirror are worth offering by default, for example mirrored properties without a local constraint, and whether their snapshots should be shared across tenants that mirror the same provider.
- **Q7. Thresholds.** The defaults are placeholders: `nuke.confirm_threshold` (500) and the `reports` `batch_limit` (1,000). *The export thresholds, `export.sync_revisions` (5,000) and `export.max_history` (1,000), were kept by A34.*
- **Q8. Attestation signatures in the `records` export.** `verify --records` checks checkpoints, proofs, headers and erasures but not the client signatures inside attestations, since the document carries no actor key records (A31). Carrying each signing actor's key records, or a `keys` section of them, with which key was current at each record's time, would let the verifier check them as `triplespace verify` does at level 2 with a key lookup; about a day's work, and one small record per signing actor. James, 2026-11-08: worth looking into as an optional enhancement.

### A2. Converted to the 0050 format

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §13
- **Change:** consolidates §14–15
- **Summary:** A1 was folded into the Decision. The open questions were numbered, and the list this ADR kept as §15, "Changes to other ADRs" (quoted below), was replaced by the generated table, so the Decision now ends at §14. No decision changed. Before this, A1 was recorded only in 0005. The file before conversion is commit `0b26a3a`.

Replaced text (§15):

> - **[0002](0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §7 and [0004](0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §10:** the correction list and the conflict list are `Special:Corrections` and `Special:IdentityConflicts` (§6).
> - **[0005](0005-crate-organization.md) §2:** the crate changes listed above.
> - **[0007](0007-actor-identity.md):** the open question on serving `Special:Redirect/user/{id}` locally is settled: it is served, with the other `Redirect` forms (§9).
> - **[0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §9:** `Special:Import` is the form for the import job, and `Special:Export` its counterpart (§8).
> - **[0010](0010-site-ui.md) §2, §3 and §12:** the Special pages link goes to `Special:SpecialPages`, the **New** menu to `NewItem` and `NewProperty`, and the full results page is `Special:Search`. The address table is now the registry.
> - **[0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §5.6 and §7:** the tables, columns and projection order of §13.
> - **[0015](0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §3 and §5, and [0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §2:** the `reports` config kind, a new registry file, and `nuke`.
> - **[0018](0018-tenants.md) §11 and [0046](0046-primary-tenant.md) §7:** the scope rule of §3.
> - **[0023](0023-moderation.md) §9 and §11:** `Special:Nuke` and `nuke`.
> - **[0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5:** the `export` class and the `sysop` row of the `job` class.
> - **[0029](0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §3:** "Create an item with this DOI" opens `Special:NewItem` with the statement filled in.
> - **[0031](0031-property-constraints.md) §3:** `ConstraintReport` defaults to the local graph.
> - **[0042](0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10:** the refresh job applies report deltas for the tables it writes (§4.3); `view.site_stats` serves the `NUMBEROF*` variables (§13).

### A3. The redirect reports

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0051](0051-page-redirects.md) §6
- **Change:** amends §10; extends §4.4
- **Summary:** `ListRedirects`, `BrokenRedirects`, `DoubleRedirects` and `RandomRedirect` leave the deferred table and are served as index-backed reports over `view.redirect`.

Replaced text (§10):

> | `ListRedirects`, `BrokenRedirects`, `DoubleRedirects`, `RandomRedirect` | deferred | Page redirects ([0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) Q8) |

### A4. `Special:Fork`

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0054](0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §2
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** A Triplespace page that forks an inherited title without an edit, restricted to `createpage`.

### A5. `PagesWithProp`

- **Date:** 2026-10-01
- **Source:** [0055](0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6
- **Change:** amends §10; extends §4.4
- **Summary:** `view.page_prop` exists, so `PagesWithProp` leaves the deferred table and is served over it. Q2 settled.

Replaced text (§10):

> | `PagesWithProp` | deferred | A page-properties table. 0042 §4 returns page properties, but none are stored. |

### A6. `Special:Query`

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0059](0059-query-service.md) §6
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** `Special:Query`, the SPARQL editor over `/sparql`, served while `query.enabled` is on. Registered in `special-pages.toml` with `requires = "query.enabled"`.

### A7. `Special:CreateSprint`

- **Date:** 2026-10-04
- **Source:** [0061](0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §9
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** `Special:CreateSprint`, restricted to `createpage`, registered in `special-pages.toml`.

### A8. `Special:CreateWorkspace`

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0062](0062-workspaces.md) §7
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** `Special:CreateWorkspace`, restricted to `createpage`, registered in `special-pages.toml`.

### A9. EntitySchema pages

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0064](0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7
- **Change:** amends §10; extends §1, §9
- **Summary:** The three EntitySchema pages move from reserved to served, with `CheckEntitySchema` added; §1's `reserved` status has no current members.

Replaced text (§10):

> - **`reserved`:** the name belongs to an entity type Triplespace has reserved but not implemented. These are Lexeme and EntitySchema ([0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md), [0041](0041-content-models.md)).

### A10. Lexeme pages

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0066](0066-lexemes.md) §7
- **Change:** extends §9
- **Summary:** `NewLexeme` and `MergeLexemes` move from reserved to served.

### A11. Proposals and merging

- **Date:** 2026-10-05
- **Source:** [0067](0067-proposals.md) §4, §7; [0068](0068-merging-with-upstream.md) §6
- **Change:** extends §6, §9
- **Summary:** `Special:Corrections`' export becomes Propose; `Special:Proposals` is new; `Special:MergeUpstream` is new.

### A12. Special:Version

- **Date:** 2026-10-07
- **Source:** [0077](0077-special-version.md) §1
- **Change:** amends §9
- **Summary:** `Special:Version` gets its own row, pointing to 0077, which specifies its sections, subpages and sources; it is no longer described as built from the registry, configuration and i18n alone.

Replaced text (§9):

> | `Version`, `ApiSandbox`, `ApiHelp`, `AllMessages`, `NamespaceInfo`, `PasswordPolicies`, `ListDatatypes`, `AvailableBadges`, `MyLanguageFallbackChain`, `Blankpage` | From the registry, configuration and i18n |

### A13. `tenant` is the slug

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** corrects §13
- **Summary:** The `tenant` column of `view.report_entry`, `view.report_state` and `view.site_stats` is `tenant text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''`, the column as [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §5 (0013 A11) defines it for every `view` table, not `tenant bigint`. (PENDING A6)

Replaced text (§13):

> CREATE TABLE view.report_entry (                -- §4.3: projection and batch reports
>   tenant bigint NOT NULL, report text NOT NULL, scope text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'local',  -- graph set (§4.2)

> CREATE TABLE view.report_state (
>   tenant bigint NOT NULL, report text NOT NULL, scope text NOT NULL,

> CREATE TABLE view.site_stats (                  -- §9: MediaWiki's site_stats
>   tenant bigint PRIMARY KEY,

### A14. No `sysop` job rate row

- **Date:** 2026-10-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-08
- **Change:** amends §12
- **Summary:** Jobs run under subsidiaries: `ts-runjob` defaults to `bot` everywhere ([0016](0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §2 drops `sysop`; [0046](0046-primary-tenant.md) §8), and an administrator runs a job, a Nuke or a job revert included, by creating or approving a subsidiary they operate. The `sysop` row this section added to the `job` rate class of [0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5 goes with it. James: "administrators should be able to run jobs under subsidiaries", read as this. (PENDING C14)

Replaced text (§12):

> The `job` rate class gains a `sysop` row, 10 per hour (amends [0024](0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5, which gave only `user` and `bot`). Without that row an administrator who is not a bot could not start a Nuke or a job revert.

### A15. `listed`, `requires`, `note` and extension origins

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** extends §1
- **Summary:** The field table of §1 gains `listed` (whether `Special:SpecialPages` lists the page), `requires` (the setting the page is served under, as A6 used for `Special:Query`), both of which the registry file already carries, and `note`; and `origin` may be any extension's name as `version.toml` lists it ([0077](0077-special-version.md) §8), not only the names §1 enumerates. (PENDING F20)

### A16. `RandomRootpage`

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** corrects §4.4
- **Summary:** The report is `RandomRootpage`, the registry's spelling and MediaWiki's first English alias; §4.4 had `RandomRootPage`. `check_adrs.py` check 5 becomes case-sensitive on canonical names so the difference is caught ([0050](0050-adr-format.md) §14, check 15). (PENDING F21)

Replaced text (§4.4):

> | `Random`, `RandomInCategory`, `RandomRootPage` | `view.page.random` (§13), as MediaWiki's `page_random` |

### A17. Current text relocated to the architecture chapters

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0050](0050-adr-format.md) §14
- **Change:** relocates §1–§14
- **Summary:** The Decision's current text now lives in the architecture chapters [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md), [09](../architecture/09-security-and-moderation.md), [18](../architecture/18-api.md), [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md), [22](../architecture/22-crates-and-stack.md), in the sections each pointer names; this ADR keeps its headings, provenance lines, Context, Consequences, Open questions and this log. The last commit in which this file carried the text is `c76d96f`. No decision changed.

### A18. Reports are a view-derived, tier-3 consumer of composition

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** [0083](0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §3, §6
- **Change:** amends §4.2, §4.3
- **Summary:** The `report` projection declares its class: it is view-derived, populated by a scan of the `view` tables it reads and never by a log replay, and "rebuild projection P for tenant T from `view`" is the named operation a batch-to-live switch uses. It is a tier-3 consumer: it consumes events — "entity X composed to version N" for entity reports, the page projection's and the refresh job's row changes for page reports — in its own queue, at its own rate, in no write's transaction, off during bootstrap and bulk modes until the operator turns it on. An entity report re-evaluates an entry only when the canonical's composed row changes and the cluster has a local member, found by an index on `cluster_id` restricted to local IDs, so a mirror's changes never fan through the report projection for clusters with no local member; a live entity report's freshness is bounded by composition lag, shown beside "computed at". "Step 5 of 0013 §7" and "the synchronous budget" are withdrawn; the refresh job's rows are events to the report projection like any other, not deltas it applies in the refresh transaction. (REVIEW G10, G13, G50)

> - **Entity reports list local subjects.** The rows are local entities, and local assertions where a report is about statements. Conditions are evaluated on the **resolved view**, as a reader sees it. For example:

> Changing a mode writes nothing into any tenant's partitions, so it is not an instance act ([0040](0040-instance-prerogatives.md) §1). When a report moves from live to batch, its next run fills its rows. When it moves from batch to live, the `report` projection rebuilds its rows for that tenant.

> A batch report's page says when it was computed, as MediaWiki's cached reports do. `list=querypage` returns `cached`, `cachedtimestamp` and `maxresults` for it.

> - The `report` projection runs after the tables it reads, in step 5 of [0013](0013-postgres-storage.md) §7 ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §6.1). Each change to an input key recomputes only the entries that key affects. For example, a new `page_link` row to a missing title adds one to that title's `WantedPages` count.
> - Report entries are **fan-out**, not part of a write's own rows. They are applied by the projection worker under 0013 §7's synchronous budget, and their lag is reported with the other projections'.
> - Some inputs are written by the refresh job rather than by replay ([0042](0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10): `transclusion`, `entity_usage`, and links and categories under expansion. For those, the refresh job applies the report deltas in the same transaction as the rows it writes.

> - `projection` entries are a function of the `view` tables they read, and are rebuilt with them.

### A19. A served page exists only once the build registers its handler

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** corrects §1, §2
- **Summary:** `served` records a decision, not an implementation, and a served page exists in a build only once it registers a handler. At startup `triplespace-titles` intersects the registry's `served` set with the handlers the binary compiled; that intersection is what the instance reports as its special pages, in `siprop=specialpagealiases` and on `Special:SpecialPages`. A served page without a handler is reported, with the difference, on `server.admin_listen`, and a request for it gets MediaWiki's "no such special page" response, so a client never learns of a page the build cannot serve. The rest of the row (`private.watch`'s `watch_target` index, encrypted upstream grants, `siprop=triplespace` as a function of configuration with the live counters moved to `GET /version`, `/provider/{code}/mirror` and `/repo/{name}`) lands in [0020](0020-change-feeds.md), [0022](0022-federation.md) and [0012](0012-api-requirements.md).

### A20. Nuke by tag, and per-entity export folded by the export job

- **Date:** 2026-10-09
- **Source:** Direct: James, design review of 2026-10-09
- **Change:** amends §8; extends §7, §13
- **Summary:** `view.activity.tags` gets a GIN index (`activity_tags`, [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.6), so a change-tag target's whole history is one index scan: Nuke's window over an account reads `view.activity` by actor, and over a tag reads it through that index. Per-revision entity export is folded by the export job, which reads one row of `view.entity_revision` per revision and folds it into the XML there, never on the request path; the revisions exported per entity are capped by `export.max_entity_history` (default 100; [23](../architecture/23-configuration-and-registry.md) §3), lower than `export.max_history` for pages, since each entity revision is a whole state rather than a text. The report half of the row (entity reports consume composition events, trigger only for a canonical with a local member, and show their composition lag) is A18's. The foreign-actor contributions view, bounded to `view.activity` with a note that upstream revisions are not indexed by actor, is [0010](0010-site-ui.md) §8's text ([19](../architecture/19-site-ui.md) §2.5), not this ADR's. (REVIEW G50)

> - **Local entities** are exported as Wikibase exports entity pages. The model is `wikibase-item` or `wikibase-property`. Each revision is one local change set, and its text is the canonical JSON of the entity's **local-graph** state at that revision ([wikibase-compat.md](../api/wikibase-compat.md)). A MediaWiki Wikibase with free IDs can import them, which is the reverse of adoption ([0035](0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md); [05](../architecture/05-providers-and-ingest.md)).

- **Source:** [0085](0085-settings-and-preferences.md) §4, §5
- **Change:** extends §1; amends §2; amends §3
- **Summary:** The registry gains three served pages: `Preferences` (MediaWiki's name, scope `tenant`, restricted to `editmyoptions`, with `DisplayNotificationsConfiguration` as its section alias for the notifications tab), `WikiSettings` (scope `tenant`) and `InstanceSettings` (scope `farm`). `Preferences` stops being a section alias of `Account`, whose `ResetTokens` alias now leads to the watchlist token and whose email aliases lead to the new Contacts section. `Tenancy` keeps its name, unlisted, as a redirect to the Tenancy tabs of the two settings pages. The chapter text is [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §1.2, §1.3 and §8.

- **Source:** [0089](0089-the-auth-host-and-instance-logins.md) §7
- **Change:** extends §3
- **Summary:** The auth base serves only the pages the registry marks `auth = true`, `UserLogin`, `CreateAccount`, `Account` and `UserLogout`, each in an auth form that acts on the instance login; every other page is a 404 there. Each is also a `tenant` page in its tenant form, and on a single-tenant instance without an auth host the tenant's base serves both forms as one. The field is pending until `triplespace-titles` accepts it. The chapter text is [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §1.3.

### A26. `NewProperty` offers the data types the API registers

- **Date:** 2026-10-29
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-29
- **Change:** amends §5
- **Summary:** `Special:NewProperty` offered fifteen data types, those the entity pages had a name for, while `siteinfo`'s `wikibase-propertytypes` reported thirteen: Wikibase's twelve built-in types and `wikibase-domain` ([0009](0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md)). The two extra were `math` and `musical-notation`, which Wikibase registers only with the Math and Score extensions, and which no ADR adopts: Triplespace validates neither TeX nor LilyPond, renders neither, and has no RDF type for them; the entity pages name them only so that mirrored Wikidata properties of those types display. James asked for the right answer and for the two lists to agree. `wikibase-propertytypes` is the authority, as it is in Wikibase, where it is the set a property may be created with: `NewProperty` offers exactly the registered types, and `Special:ListDatatypes` lists the same ones in the same order. A data type joins the list when an ADR adopts it and the API serves it.

Replaced text ([21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §3.1, as it stood):

> - `NewProperty` needs `property-create` and a `datatype`.

### A27. Special:SpecialPages lists by the registry's headings

- **Date:** 2026-10-31
- **Source:** Direct: James, confirmed 2026-10-31; Claude's call while building the grouped Special:SpecialPages, 2026-10-31
- **Change:** extends §1
- **Summary:** §1 gives every page a `group`, "the heading under which `Special:SpecialPages` lists it", and makes `listed` and `restricted` decide whether it is listed, but leaves the order of the headings, their names and the order within one to the page. The page lists its headings in a fixed order, MediaWiki's groups in the order Wikimedia wikis show them, then Wikibase's and Triplespace's, with `other` last as MediaWiki keeps it; names each with MediaWiki's or Wikibase's message, and Triplespace's two as *Identity and corrections* and *Instance administration*; orders the pages under a heading by their names in the reader's language; and gives each heading MediaWiki's class and id (`mw-specialpagesgroup`, `mw-specialpagesgroup-{key}`), which gadgets and user scripts select. Until this entry the page was one list in the order its code gave, and listed restricted pages to every reader. `requires` is not applied by the page yet, since the site does not receive a tenant's `site` settings. The chapter text is 21 §1.1.

### A28. The special-page registry is embedded by `scatter-titles`

- **Date:** 2026-10-31
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-10-31
- **Change:** corrects §1
- **Summary:** §1's text said the registry is embedded by `triplespace-titles`. The crate map (22 §2.1) gives the registry to `scatter-titles`, the pure crate that embeds the namespace registry and builds for `wasm32`, and `triplespace-titles` is the DB-backed resolver over it, not yet built; `scatter-titles` has embedded `special-pages.toml` since the grouped `Special:SpecialPages` (A27). The decision is unchanged; the chapter now names the crate that holds it. The chapter text is 21 §1.1.

Replaced text ([21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §1.1, as it stood):

> It is embedded by `triplespace-titles`, which already resolves titles in the `Special` namespace ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §3).

### A29. `page_random` is derived from the page

- **Date:** 2026-11-02
- **Source:** Direct: Claude, while building rebuild equivalence for the Librarybase full-history adoption, 2026-11-02; confirmed by James, 2026-11-13
- **Change:** amends §13
- **Summary:** `view.page.random` is computed from the page, not drawn: the first 52 bits of the MD5 of `{tenant}:{page_id}`, as a fraction in [0, 1). A log-replayed projection is a function of the log ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §6.1), and a value drawn when the row is created is a new value on every rebuild: the Librarybase rebuild of 2026-11-02 differed from the adopted views in every document page's `random`. The hash is uniform as MediaWiki's draw is, so `Special:Random` and `list=random` pick as evenly; the difference is that the value is reproducible, the same page always sorting to the same place. A source's own `page_random` is not in an XML export, so adoption could not keep it either way. Migration `0025_page_random` recomputes existing rows. The chapter text is [03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.5.

Replaced text ([03](../architecture/03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §4.5, as it stood):

> - `random double precision`: drawn at creation, as `page_random`.

### A30. The `records` export is one document, and leaves out what no checkpoint covers

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8
- **Summary:** Asked how to build §8's `records` format (SCA-302), James chose: the export is one canonical-CBOR document carrying the checkpoints as signed notes, the key records, and per partition the records with their shared proof nodes once, rather than a bundle-shaped tree or JSON; a selected record newer than its partition's latest checkpoint is left out and listed as pending, rather than refusing the export or carrying it unproved, since checkpoints are signed by the instance's signer and not on request; and records are selected as the XML export selects pages, by title with or without history under the same caps, the records being the targets' rows in the tenant's `pages` and `local` partitions, rather than also by explicit record coordinates. Chapter text: [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §4.2.

### A31. The `records` export as built

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: Claude, while building the `records` export (SCA-302), 2026-11-08; confirmed by James, 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8
- **Summary:** Calls made building A30. (1) It is served by `POST /export` in the REST API with a JSON body (`format`, `pages` as a list or one title per line, `history`) and the media type `application/vnd.triplespace.records+cbor`; `Special:Export`, the XML format (`501 not-built`) and export jobs wait for SCA-300 and the job runner, so a selection over `export.sync_revisions` records is refused with `413 export-too-large`, and the `export` rate class is not applied yet. (2) The document's fields are `format` (`triplespace-records`), `version` (1), `created`, `keys`, `missing` and `partitions`, each partition with `partition`, `name`, `origin`, `checkpoint`, `nodes`, `records` (`offset`, `record` or `leaf`, `withheld`, `path`) and `pending`; it lives in `scatter-integrity::records` with its verifier, and the builder beside the bundle code in `triplespace-rdf`. (3) A title in an entity namespace names that local entity; `history` is off by default, as `Special:Export`'s `curonly` is on, is honoured only where `export.history` is, and is capped by `export.max_history` per page and `export.max_entity_history` per entity. (4) Records are shown as the export scope shows them to the caller, decided as the record route decides ([0012](0012-api-requirements.md) A85), so a revision-deleted part is withheld from every caller; a page or entity whose records would all be leaves alone, or which has none, is listed in `missing` with what was asked, as an absent one is, and the leaves are not carried. (5) `triplespace verify --records` checks each checkpoint against the key chain in the file, each leaf by its proof, each header against its partition and offset, and each withheld part as erased; it does not check the signatures inside attestations, since the actor key records they need are not carried. Chapter text: [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §4.2.

### A32. Page statements travel in `records` only

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.1
- **Summary:** Settles Q4. Asked whether MediaWiki XML should carry page statements as an extra slot only Triplespace would read, James chose `records` only: the XML stays a plain MediaWiki export that a stock importer reads whole, and the verifiable format already carries every record of a page. Chapter text: 21 §4.2.

### A33. `templates` in export waits for `view.transclusion`

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.1
- **Summary:** Asked whether to build `view.transclusion` (0042 §10) first or ship `Special:Export` without `templates`, James chose to defer the parameter until the functionality exists: until then it is accepted and the response says that no templates were added. Chapter text: 21 §4.2.

### A34. The export thresholds stand

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, design discussion of 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.1
- **Summary:** Of Q7's placeholders, James kept `export.sync_revisions` (5,000) and `export.max_history` (1,000) as the defaults, both tenant settings a tenant raises; Q7 keeps `nuke.confirm_threshold` and the `reports` `batch_limit`. Chapter text: 21 §4.2.

### A35. The MediaWiki XML export as built

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: Claude, while building the MediaWiki XML export (SCA-300), 2026-11-08; confirmed by James, 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.1
- **Summary:** Calls made building the XML format of §8.1 (A32–A34; 0005 A119). (1) `POST /export` takes `format: xml` with the `records` body of A31 and, for the XML, `categories` (`addcat`) and `namespaces` (`addns`, refused with `403 export-namespaces-off` where `export.from_namespaces` is off), each adding up to MediaWiki's `$wgExportPagelistLimit`, 5,000 pages, and `templates`; it streams `application/xml` once the selection is planned, so a `413` comes before any byte, and says what it left out in `x-export-missing` and what it has to say in `x-export-notice`, the `templates` notice also written into the document as an XML comment after `<siteinfo>`. (2) A revision's text, comment or attestation that the export scope withholds, or that is erased, is written as revision-deleted content; a record withheld whole is left out, and a target with none left is missing, as `records` lists it. (3) Every revision of a page is written with the page's current content model, since the page record carries no model of its own at each revision; `<origin>` is the revision's own ID; `<sha1>` is computed over the text. (4) Local entities are written from `view.entity_revision` on the request path, as `records` reads them, there being no export job yet; their titles and models follow the entity type (`Item`, `Property`, `Lexeme`, and the keyed types' namespaces); a local redirect's text is Wikibase's `{"entity", "redirect"}`. (5) Mirrored pages wait for the `pages/{repo}` partition and `view.foreign_page`, neither projected yet; files and threads are out of scope. (6) `action=query&export` writes the page set's current revisions, as MediaWiki does; `exportnowrap` sends the document as `text/xml`; `exportschema` is accepted, 0.11 always written and 0.10 warned about. For `addcat` the form needs `list=categorymembers`, built with `cmtitle` and `cmlimit` only (0038 §13). (7) `Special:Export` reads the tenant's `export.from_namespaces` and `export.history` from `meta=siteinfo`'s `triplespace.export`, and is offered under the `export` capability; it adds a category's or a namespace's pages through the API and, without `wpDownload`, shows the file rather than saving it; `records` is its second format. (8) `scatter-mediawiki-xml`'s reader keeps `<siteinfo>` and reads the further slots of a 0.11 dump; its writer computes MediaWiki's base-36 SHA-1, so the crate depends on `sha1`, and `triplespace-rdf` reads content-model formats from `scatter-pages` (0005 A120). Chapter text: 21 §4.2.

### A36. `Special:Import` and `action=import` as built

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: Claude, while building the MediaWiki XML import (SCA-303), 2026-11-08; confirmed by James, 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.3
- **Summary:** Calls made building §8.3 over the import job ([0008](0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) A49). (1) `Special:Import` is offered under the `import` capability and restricted to the `import` right; it posts `multipart/form-data`, the first time for the census, which it shows with a confirmation, and the second time to import, showing the job's report with the job named, since `Special:Jobs/{id}` is not built. (2) The site keeps nothing between requests, so an uploaded file rides along the confirmation as a hidden base64 field when it is at most 2 MB and is asked for again otherwise; a page of another wiki is fetched again on confirmation. (3) `action=import` is MediaWiki's module: `xml` as a multipart upload (`importupload`), `interwikisource` a site alias of `sites.toml` with `interwikipage`, `fullhistory` and `templates` passed to that wiki's `Special:Export` at its article path, `interwikiprefix`, `summary` and `tags`; Triplespace adds `census`, which answers the census and writes nothing, and the response's `job` (the ID, the counts, the talk conversion, what was left out, the rejects) beside MediaWiki's `import` list, whose entries also say whether the page was created and how many revisions it already held. (4) An upload or a fetched export is at most 64 MB, and the server's request body limit, 2 MB by default, bounds an upload through the API until it is raised. (5) The Action API reads a `multipart/form-data` body for every module, its text fields as body parameters. Chapter text: 21 §4.3.

### A37. The XML export writes the model each revision had

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of A35 on 2026-11-08
- **Change:** amends §8.1
- **Summary:** A35 (3) wrote every revision of a page with the page's current content model, since a page record carries no model of its own at each revision. James chose correctness: the exporter walks the page's records as it writes them, the `create`'s model and then each `edit`'s change, so a revision carries the model it had, and the `<format>` follows; where the records that set the model are withheld, the page's current model stands. A page's model changes rarely, and the records are read for the text anyway, so the walk costs nothing more. Chapter text: 21 §4.2.

> - **Pages.** Each page record is a `<revision>`, with its content model and format ([0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md)): the page's current model for every revision, since a page record carries no model of its own at each revision; `<origin>` is the revision's own ID and `<sha1>` is computed over the text ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) A35).

### A38. `import.max_upload`

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** Direct: James, review of A36 on 2026-11-08
- **Change:** extends §8.3
- **Summary:** The size an import may be is a setting, `import.max_upload` (tenant-bound, 100 MB by default, MediaWiki's `$wgMaxUploadSize`), applied to an upload and to a fetched export alike and reported in `meta=siteinfo` as `triplespace.import`; the server's request body limit on `api.php` and on the site's forms is its ceiling, 1 GB, which bounds every tenant's value. `Special:Import` names the limit under its file field, and carries a file of up to 8 MB along the confirmation as a hidden field, asking for a larger one again, since a base64 copy of a large file in a form would be worse than a second choice. Chapter text: 21 §4.3; 23 (`settings.toml`).

### A39. `Special:CreateEntities`

- **Date:** 2026-11-08
- **Source:** [0104](0104-batches-and-the-job-runner.md) §11
- **Change:** extends §5
- **Summary:** Beside the Wikibase compatibility forms, a form of Triplespace's own: `Special:CreateEntities`, many items from one table, each row one `wbeditentity` through the same handler as `Special:NewItem`, under a batch, after a preview checks the rows. Registered in `special-pages.toml` under `wikibaserepo`, restricted to `createpage`. Chapter text: [21](../architecture/21-special-pages.md) §6.6.
