# 03. Storage, caches and search

This chapter describes where Triplespace's bytes live and how they are served: Postgres as the store of the log and of every projection the API and UI read, the four schemas and the roles that may read them, the `log` schema and its packed stored form, the `view` schema with one catalogue of every table later ADRs added to it, projections and their synchrony with the write path, the shared views and overlays that tenancy adds, the blob store, the cache layers and their keys, HTTP and response caching, and search on OpenSearch with its Postgres fallback. It assumes the log, records, partitions, erasure and integrity of [01](01-log-and-records.md), the graphs and RDF output of [02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md), the tenants of [08](08-tenants-and-instances.md) and the security model of [09](09-security-and-moderation.md); the crate map and the deployment profiles are in [22](22-crates-and-stack.md), bootstrap and bulk loading in [05](05-providers-and-ingest.md), and the web tier that sits in front of the API in [20](20-web-tier.md).

## 1. Postgres as the store

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §1, §4; [0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) §4.4; [0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §4.*

### 1.1 Postgres holds the log

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §1.*

The log records of [0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) are rows in Postgres. The alternative, segment files on disk with Postgres holding only `(partition, offset)` pointers, is MediaWiki's external-storage split; it is not used, because every interactive write would then span two systems:

- appending the record;
- allocating its global revision ID ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §2.1);
- checking the base offset ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §8);
- updating the projections a reader expects to see at once (§6).

In one database, these are one transaction. Erasure becomes an `UPDATE`, compaction a `DELETE`, and backup, replication and point-in-time recovery are the database's.

**The segment file format stays.** `scatter-log` keeps a file format for two purposes:

- **export bundles** ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §9), which `verify` reads without a database;
- **Scatterbase**, which may store its claim log in files.

`scatter-log` therefore defines a `LogStore` trait with two backends ([0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) §2). The record and header formats, the hash tags, the Merkle tree and the checkpoint format of 0006 are unchanged. What changes is where the bytes live.

**Segments are offset ranges.** A segment is the range `[n·2^k, (n+1)·2^k)` of a partition. It is sealed when every offset in the range has been appended and its manifest written. Nothing physical corresponds to it in Postgres. The file backend writes one file per segment, as before.

### 1.2 Four schemas and the roles that read them

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §4.*

| Schema | Holds | Lifetime | Role that may read it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `log` | §2: partitions, records, Merkle nodes, checkpoints, manifests | Permanent. The source of truth. | The server, the ingester, `verify` |
| `view` | §4: every projection the API and UI read | Rebuildable from `log` at any time | The server |
| `private` | State that belongs to one account and has no public history: the accounts graph's binding index, password hashes for the built-in `password` issuer ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) A3), sessions' secrets, IP addresses held for abuse handling and IP blocks, when each binding was last used ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §3, [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5, [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §3); the watch set and its Atom token ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §3); inboxes and read state ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §3); email addresses, fediverse handles, and the ActivityPub keys and followers of the notifier and of every opted-in actor ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §5, §8, [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §6); subsidiaries' API keys, OAuth tokens and confidential consumers' secrets ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §4, [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8); every preference, including the notification matrix and the auto-watch flags ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §1); the IP row behind each edit-filter hit ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11). §5 lists the tables | Permanent; never exported. The portable part travels with an account as a user data bundle, and with a cooperative tenant move as a sealed private extract applied on reclaim ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §2–4); nothing else leaves ([0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §10) | `triplespace-accounts`, `triplespace-notify` and, for `ap_key` and `ap_follower` only, `triplespace-federation` |
| `ops` | Projection positions (§6), job runtime state, the bootstrap coordinator's block table ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §9), the email and fediverse delivery queue ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §8, [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §7), and the asynchronous jobs that are not log jobs: large user-data exports ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §3), filter tests ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §6) and property-wide constraint re-checks ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §2) | Operational | The server, the ingester, the notifier |

**Privacy is enforced by grants.** The database role the public API connects with has no privilege on `private`. Only the accounts service ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §10), the notifier ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §10) and the federation service ([0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §13), for actor keys and followers, connect with a role that does; all three are holder-only services, and none serves a route that returns another account's rows. The OAuth server ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8) reaches `private` only through the accounts service. The privacy test of [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §8, which checks that no route returns private data, is backed by a check that no query outside those three crates can. Where a private set has to meet public data, as the watch set meets `view.activity`, the private side resolves to a list of identifiers and hands it to a query under the public role ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §3); there is no cross-schema join. `pg_dump` for exports and verification bundles excludes `private` and `ops`.

**The roles are named** `ts_server` (the server and the ingester), `ts_accounts`, `ts_notify`, `ts_federation` and `ts_verify` (read-only on `log`), created by `triplespace-db`'s migrations as `NOLOGIN` group roles that a deployment grants to its login roles; `ts_server` holds no privilege on `private`.

**The accounts partition is in `log`.** Bindings are log records ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §8), and they keep their `logged` integrity. Their child table is in the `log` schema but owned by the accounts role, and the public role's `SELECT` on `log.record` is granted per child table, excluding it.

### 1.3 Storage contracts

*Sources: [0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) §4.4.*

`scatter-quadstore` is the storage contract from Scatterbase's plan: `lookup(s, p, o, g)` with wildcards, and since [0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §9 `apply(deleted, inserted)`. Scatterbase's drivers implement it, and it is Scatterbase's serving store. In Triplespace it is a consumer of `view.rdf_delta` ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §8): an instance that wants a local SPARQL endpoint applies the same deltas the SPARQL Update stream serializes, and nothing reads from it but the query service of [0059](../decisions/0059-query-service.md) §1.

Triplespace's serving store is the `view` schema (§4). It is not a shared seam. Scatterbase has no need of it, and its tables are Wikibase-shaped by design.

`LogStore` in `scatter-log` is the third contract, and the one both products share fully ([0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) §4.2).

Extra access paths, such as claim retrieval or chain traversal, are separate traits in the crates that need them. They are not added to `scatter-quadstore` or `LogStore`.

### 1.4 Version, driver, queries, migrations and queues

*Sources: [0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §4.*

- **Version:** 17 is the minimum; 18 is the target. The schema uses features from 15 and later (`UNIQUE NULLS NOT DISTINCT`), 14 (lz4 TOAST) and none from extensions. **No Postgres extension is required**, so the small profile runs on any managed Postgres.
- **Driver:** `tokio-postgres` with `deadpool-postgres` for pooling. It gives binary `COPY` for bootstrap ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §9), pipelining, and exact control of the append transaction and its row lock (§2.1). `LogStore` is itself asynchronous, because the append shares the write path's transaction (§6), and a blocking caller drives it with an executor instead.
- **Queries:** hand-written SQL in each owning crate. No ORM. Query shapes are checked by integration tests against a real database ([0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §15), not by compile-time macros, because several crates share one schema and migrations run in a fixed cross-crate order.
- **Migrations:** each owning crate embeds its SQL files ([0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) rule 9). A small runner in `triplespace-db` applies them in 0005's build order, each in its own transaction, and records each with a checksum in `ops.migration`; a recorded migration whose SQL has changed is refused, since a schema change is a new migration, never an edit. `refinery` is an acceptable substitute if the in-house runner stops being small.
- **Queues and background work:** `ops` tables claimed with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, woken with `LISTEN/NOTIFY`. This covers the ActivityPub delivery queue ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md)), exports ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md)), filter tests ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md)), constraint re-checks ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md)) and jobs ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md)). No broker.

## 2. The `log` schema

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §2, §6.*

### 2.1 Partitions and records

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §2; [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §2.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE log.partition (
  partition     bigint PRIMARY KEY,            -- 64 random bits, fixed at creation (0018 §2); 0 is the instance config
  tenant        text,                          -- tenant slug, or NULL for an instance partition (0018 §2)
  name          text NOT NULL,                 -- "local", "mirror/wikidata", "pages", …
  graph_iri     text NOT NULL,                 -- {base}/graph/{name} (0015 §5)
  history       text NOT NULL,                 -- full | latest            (0002 §2)
  integrity     text NOT NULL,                 -- logged | hashed          (0006 §4)
  export        text NOT NULL,                 -- public | internal | private (0005 §4.1, 0007 §8)
  segment_k     smallint NOT NULL,             -- segments hold 2^k records (0006 §5)
  hash          text NOT NULL,                 -- named in the genesis record (0006 §2, 0015 §3)
  next_offset   bigint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  UNIQUE (tenant, name)                        -- the registry key of 0018 §2
);

CREATE TABLE log.record (
  partition     bigint   NOT NULL REFERENCES log.partition,
  "offset"      bigint   NOT NULL,
  appended_at   bigint   NOT NULL,             -- µs since the epoch, UTC   (header 3)
  payload_type  text     NOT NULL,             --                          (header 4)
  key           text,                          -- identifier, never content (header 5)
  commitment    bytea    NOT NULL,             -- root over the part leaves, 32 bytes (header 6, 0015 §1)
  revid         bigint,                        -- global or provider-ranged revision ID (header 7, 0015 §2)
  logid         bigint,                        -- global log ID (header 8, 0015 §2)
  page_id       bigint,                        -- page ID of the key, carried forward (header 9, 0015 §2)
  header        bytea    NOT NULL,             -- the canonical CBOR header, the Merkle preimage
  leaf          bytea    NOT NULL,             -- H(0x00 ‖ header)
  body          bytea    NOT NULL,             -- canonical CBOR; an erased part is [null, leaf] (0015 §1)
  erased        smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- bitmask of erased parts (0015 §7)
  erased_by     bigint,                        -- offset of the latest erase record touching this row
  PRIMARY KEY (partition, "offset")
) PARTITION BY LIST (partition);
```

Packed storage (§3) adds `storage` to `log.partition` and `codec` and `dict` to `log.record`; the `ALTER TABLE` statements are in §3.2.

- **One child table per log partition**, which since [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §2 means one per tenant partition as well as one per shared partition. Compaction, vacuum, bootstrap loading and index choice are then per partition. A mirror partition under `latest` carries an index on `(key, "offset" DESC)` for compaction and the version cursor. The local partition carries the same index for base-offset checks. Whether small tenants should share physical tables is open in 0018.
- **The header columns are denormalized from `header`.** The CBOR bytes are the preimage that `leaf` and every proof are computed over. The columns exist so that the header can be queried without decoding. A test checks that re-encoding the columns reproduces the bytes. `revid`, `logid` and `page_id` are header fields 7–9 ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2), so they are inside the Merkle tree.
- **Bodies use TOAST with `lz4` compression in a `plain` partition.** Canonical CBOR compresses well, and `lz4` decompresses fast enough for the read path. Bodies are never queried inside the database; they are decoded by the server. A `packed` partition (§3) stores each body instead as zstd, against a dictionary trained per dedup domain, over a packed form in which repeated subtrees (references, qualifier sets and, under `full` history, whole statements) are fragment references into `log.fragment`; `log.partition` gains `storage`, `log.record` gains `codec` and `dict`, and `log.fragment_domain`, `log.fragment` and `log.dict` hold the domains, fragments and dictionaries. The packed form is physical: the body is rebuilt byte for byte, and every rebuilt body, plain or packed, is checked against `commitment` before it is used.
- **A body is never `NULL`.** Under [0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §1 erasure is per part, and an erased part is rewritten as `[null, leaf]` so the commitment still verifies. `erased` records which parts are gone; a fully erased record has every bit set. Which `erase` record removed which part is recoverable from the `erase` records themselves, which name their targets and parts; `erased_by` is a convenience for the gap row of [0010](../decisions/0010-site-ui.md) §5.2 and holds the latest one.

**Offsets are allocated in the appending transaction.** The transaction locks the partition's row in `log.partition`, takes `next_offset`, inserts, and advances it. A rollback releases the offsets, so the sequence stays gapless as [0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §3 requires. Appends to one partition are serialized by that lock. This is the correct behaviour for the local partition, where edits must be ordered, and irrelevant for bulk ingest, which uses bootstrap mode ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §9).

### 2.2 Merkle nodes, checkpoints and manifests

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §2.*

**Merkle nodes are persisted.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE log.merkle_node (
  partition bigint   NOT NULL,
  level     smallint NOT NULL,                 -- 0 is the leaf level
  index     bigint   NOT NULL,
  hash      bytea    NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (partition, level, index)
);
```

An inclusion proof for a record in a partition of 10^8 records needs 27 sibling hashes. Recomputing them from leaves would read millions of rows; reading them from this table reads 27. In a `hashed` partition, each segment's tree is stored the same way and stands alone.

**Checkpoints and manifests** are rows, not files. [0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §6 says checkpoints are "stored beside their partition"; a table is beside the partition.

```sql
CREATE TABLE log.checkpoint (
  partition   bigint   NOT NULL,
  tree_size   bigint   NOT NULL,
  root        bytea    NOT NULL,
  key_id      text     NOT NULL,               -- the signed-note key hash of the signing key, 8 hex digits (0006 §6)
  signed_note text     NOT NULL,               -- the C2SP note, verbatim
  written_at  timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (partition, tree_size)
);

CREATE TABLE log.segment_manifest (
  partition   bigint   NOT NULL,
  segment     bigint   NOT NULL,
  root        bytea    NOT NULL,
  replaces    bigint[] NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}',  -- manifests this one supersedes after compaction
  signed_note text     NOT NULL,
  sealed_at   timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (partition, segment, sealed_at)
);
```

`GET /record/{partition}/{offset}/checkpoint` ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5) is `SELECT min(tree_size) WHERE tree_size > offset`.

### 2.3 Global revision, log and page IDs

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §6.*

[0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §2.1 asks for one sequence for revisions and one for log events, assigned at append and stored in the record. Postgres sequences do this, one set per tenant ([0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §2), since MediaWiki clients expect one sequence per wiki:

- `log.revision_id` is taken for every record appended to a partition whose records are this tenant's revisions: `local` and `pages`. It is written to header field 7 and to `log.record.revid` in the appending transaction.
- `log.log_id` is taken for every record that projects as a log event ([0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §6.1), which includes the records of the tenant's `actors` partition, and for every record in the tenant's log partition, written to header field 8 and `log.record.logid`.
- `log.page_id` is taken the first time a key is written in any partition, and every later record for that key repeats it in header field 9 ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2). It is never derived from replay order. Talk pages take theirs from the same sequence through the thread record that first attaches to them ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §2).
- Mirror records take a **provider-ranged** revision ID, `provider_number << 40 | n` ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §2), computed by the writer with no allocation. A page served by a page repository takes a provider-ranged **page ID** the same way, `provider_number << 40 | upstream page ID`, derived and never minted; `log.page_id` therefore stays below 2^40 ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6).
- Local entity IDs come from one more set of per-tenant sequences, one per minted entity type (`log.item_id`, `log.property_id`, …), taken in the appending transaction as Wikibase's `wb_id_counters` are; the ID blocks of [0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.5 reserve ranges from them. An adoption sets every sequence here, entity, page, revision, log and user IDs, past what the source wiki consumed, records the floors in its job record, and supplies `page_id` for adopted records rather than taking one ([0035](../decisions/0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) §4).

**The instance's own sequences** live under the reserved tenant name `instance`, which no tenant may take as its slug: `log."instance.job_id"` for job IDs ([0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §6.3), `log."instance.log_id"` and `log."instance.page_id"` for records in the instance partitions, and one `log."instance.{type}_surrogate"` per keyed type ([0009](../decisions/0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §7). A mirrored entity's page ID is taken from `log."instance.page_id"` the first time its key is written, since it belongs to no tenant; only a page served by a page repository has a provider-ranged page ID ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6). Per-tenant sequences also include `log."{tenant}.user_id"` ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §3).

The IDs are inside the hashed header, so an inclusion proof covers them, an export bundle needs no sidecar, and an erased record keeps them.

## 3. Packed record storage

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §1, §2, §3, §3.1, §4, §5, §6, §9, §10.*

### 3.1 Stored form and logical form

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §1 (shared with [01](01-log-and-records.md)).*

A record's **logical form** is what [0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §1 and payloads.md define: the header and the body of salted parts, in canonical CBOR. Everything that hashes, signs, proves, exports or crosses a wire uses the logical form: leaves, commitments, content hashes, checkpoints, inclusion proofs, bundles, the `segments` backend, `LogStore::read` and `scan`, and every API. The logical form itself is the subject of [01](01-log-and-records.md).

A record's **stored form** is how `scatter-log-postgres` keeps the body in `log.record`. It is physical: the body is rebuilt from it byte for byte, and nothing outside the store can tell which form a row uses. Changing the stored form is never a format version. A partition may hold rows in several stored forms at once, and `repack` (§3.8) converts rows between them.

**Every read checks the commitment.** When a stored body is rebuilt, the store recomputes each present part's leaf and the commitment, and compares the result with the row's `commitment` column (header field 6). This costs one SHA-256 pass over a few kilobytes, a few microseconds. A mismatch is a `Corrupt` error, which is logged and never served. A packing bug, a damaged dictionary or a wrongly deleted fragment therefore fails loudly on the first read, never silently. A `plain` row is checked the same way.

### 3.2 Schema additions

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §2.*

```sql
ALTER TABLE log.partition
  ADD COLUMN storage text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'plain';   -- plain | packed (§9)

ALTER TABLE log.record
  ADD COLUMN codec smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,       -- 0 plain: body is the logical body
                                                      -- 1 packed: body is zstd(packed body), §3–4

- **The child table of a packed partition sets `body` to `STORAGE EXTERNAL`,** so TOAST never tries to recompress zstd output. `log.fragment`'s children do the same for `bytes`. A plain partition keeps `lz4` as before.
- **Fragments, dictionaries and domains belong in the `log` schema.** Bodies cannot be rebuilt without them, so they share the log's backup and recovery point and the read grants of `ts_server` and `ts_verify` (§1.2). They are never exported: bundles carry logical bytes.
- **Fragments have one child table per domain,** so a tenant's fragments are dropped, vacuumed and sized on their own.

### 3.3 Fragments

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §3.*

A **packed body** is the logical body with zero or more subtrees inside present parts replaced by **fragment references**. Erased parts (`[null, leaf]`) are left as they are.

- **A reference** is CBOR tag `0x54530001` wrapping a 16-byte string. Canonical CBOR has no tags (payloads.md §1), so a tag in stored form is unambiguous. The tag is never registered, and it never appears outside `log.record` and `log.fragment`.
- **`ref`** is the first 16 bytes of HMAC-SHA-256 under the domain's `key`, computed over the subtree's **logical** bytes (with nested references expanded). A ref therefore does not depend on how the subtree's own children were packed. Being keyed, refs cannot be computed or probed without the key, and colliding inputs cannot be crafted. At 128 bits, accidental collisions are negligible: about 10⁻¹⁵ expected at 10¹² distinct fragments. Any collision, accidental or not, is still caught by §3.1's commitment check.
- **A fragment's `bytes`** are the subtree's canonical CBOR, packed in turn: a statement fragment can refer to its reference fragments. Rebuilding splices bytes recursively. Because canonical CBOR is compositional (a map's encoding is its header followed by its encoded pairs), splicing reproduces the logical bytes exactly, with no re-encoding. The depth limit is 4.
- **The packer is generic.** `scatter-log` walks CBOR by path pattern and knows nothing about Wikibase. The Wikibase knowledge lives in the registry file, so that file can change at any time, and `repack` (§3.8) applies the change to old rows.

**Which subtrees become fragments** is registry data. `docs/registry/fragments.toml` is authoritative and gives path patterns per payload type, a `history` condition and `min_bytes`. It lists:

| Payload type | Path | History | What |
|---|---|---|---|
| `scatter:v0/changeset` | `/**/claims/*/*/references/*` | any | One reference: `snaks`, `snaks-order`, `hash` where kept |
| `scatter:v0/changeset` | `/references/*/*` | any | One reference added by an `add` op |
| `scatter:v0/changeset` | `/**/claims/*/*/qualifiers` | any | A statement's qualifier map |
| `scatter:v0/changeset` | `/**/claims/*/*` | `full` | A whole statement, GUID included, which repeats across one entity's revisions |

A subtree is packed only if it encodes to at least `min_bytes` (64 initially). A reference costs 22 bytes (a 5-byte tag head, a 1-byte string head and 16 bytes of ref), so anything smaller is cheaper inline. Repeats inside one record are packed once. Statement fragments are limited to `full` partitions: in a `latest` partition every statement GUID is unique to its entity and every edit replaces the statement, so a fragment for it would save nothing and become garbage on the next compaction.

### 3.4 Writing a packed record

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §3.1.*

Inside the appending transaction (§6), after the logical record is sealed (header, leaf and commitment unchanged), a packed partition:

1. reads its domain's row (`epoch`, `sweeping`, `body_dict`, `frag_dict`), one cached heap page;
2. packs the body bottom-up, computing each ref locally;
3. writes the fragments:
   - **No sweep running:** a ref the process holds in its *known-shared* cache (§9.5) for the current epoch is skipped. Every other ref goes through `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (domain, ref) DO NOTHING RETURNING ref`. Refs that conflicted are marked with `UPDATE log.fragment SET shared = true WHERE domain = $d AND ref = ANY($conflicted) AND NOT shared`, which locks only rows that are not yet shared. That is at most once in each fragment's life, so a popular reference is never a hot row.
   - **A sweep running:** every ref, cached or not, goes through `INSERT … ON CONFLICT (domain, ref) DO UPDATE SET epoch = $epoch, shared = true`. This pins it against the sweep (§3.7). Pinning costs row locks for the sweep's duration, which is why bulk loads and sweeps exclude each other ([0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §7).
4. compresses the packed body with the domain's body dictionary and inserts the row with `codec = 1`.

### 3.5 Dictionaries

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §4.*

Small bodies and fragments compress badly alone, and well against a dictionary trained on their siblings. The keys, data-type names, common property IDs and common item IDs that every Wikidata entity repeats are exactly what a dictionary captures.

- **Dictionaries are per domain and purpose** (`body`, `fragment`), trained with zstd's trainer (`ZDICT_trainFromBuffer`, through the `zstd` crate) on a sample of that domain's packed bodies or fragments, about 110 kB each.
- **A domain starts without a dictionary** and compresses with plain zstd. `triplespace-cli storage retrain` trains one once a domain holds enough samples (10,000 bodies by default). New writes use the new dictionary, and old rows keep the one they name.
- **Dictionaries are immutable and never deleted while a row names them,** checked by `retrain --prune`. They are small enough to keep forever, and every process holds the dictionaries of the domains it serves.
- **Level:** zstd 3 for interactive appends and 19 for `repack` and bulk loads. Decompression speed is about the same at either level.

### 3.6 Reading

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §5.*

`LogStore::read` and `scan` return logical records. For a packed row the store decompresses the body, collects its refs, fetches the missing ones with one `SELECT … WHERE domain = $d AND ref = ANY($refs)` per batch (a page of records in a `scan`), splices them, recurses for nested refs, and checks the commitment (§3.1). Fragments are immutable, so the fragment cache (§9.5) holds them without invalidation except on erasure.

The serving read of a `source` entity (§4.2) is therefore one row, at most one fragment query on a cold cache, and a decompression. Above the store, the L1 entity JSON cache (§9.4) hides even that for hot entities.

### 3.7 Garbage: candidates, sweeps and erasure

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §6 (shared with [01](01-log-and-records.md)).*

There are no reference counts. A fragment becomes garbage only when the rows that used it are compacted away or erased, and two mechanisms reclaim it.

**Candidates.** Compaction and erasure write the refs of what they remove (the deleted rows' bodies, the erased parts) into `ops.fragment_candidate`, in their own transaction. A **candidate sweep** deletes every candidate that is **not `shared`**. `shared = false` means exactly one append ever used the fragment, and that append's row is the one just removed. Deleting a fragment makes its nested refs candidates in turn. A shared candidate is left for a full sweep, and the domain's count of such leftovers decides when one is worth running.

**Full sweeps.** A **full sweep** marks every ref reachable from the domain's live rows (bodies, then nested fragments) into a temporary table, then deletes every fragment that is not marked and whose `epoch` is older than the sweep's.

**The fence.** Both kinds of sweep start the same way:

1. set `sweeping = true` and increment `epoch` on the domain's row;
2. wait until every transaction that began before that commit has ended, as `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY` does.

After the fence, every append into the domain sees `sweeping` and pins each ref it uses (§3.4 step 3). An append that began before the fence has committed by the time marking starts, so the mark sees its row. If a deletion and a pin race on the same fragment, Postgres's row lock decides. If the pin commits first, the deletion's recheck finds the new `epoch` and skips the row. If the deletion commits first, the pin's `INSERT` finds no row and writes the fragment again, from the bytes the writer is holding. When the sweep ends, `sweeping` is cleared and a `NOTIFY ts_fragment` names the domain and epoch.

**Erasure.** The erase transaction rewrites the target's body as [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §3 says (in [01](01-log-and-records.md)). In a packed row the remaining parts stay packed, and the erased parts' refs become candidates. The erasure worker then runs a candidate sweep before the `VACUUM` it already runs, so bytes used only by the erased record are gone within the same job. A fragment the erased record **shared** with other rows is still held by them, legitimately, unless they too are gone. For reason class `legal`, the worker therefore runs a full sweep of the domain as well, and vacuums the domain's fragment table afterwards. The vacuum policy covers the fragment tables as it covers `log.record`.

### 3.8 Which partitions are packed; measurement and repacking

*Sources: [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §9, §10.*

`log.partition.storage` is an operator setting, not a log record: `[storage] packed = ["mirror/*", "local"]` in the server's configuration, applied when a partition is created and changed later with `storage pack` and `repack`. The default is `plain` for every partition until the measurements of 0058's Q1 are recorded there. Then `mirror/*` is expected to become `packed`, since mirror partitions hold nearly all of the volume.

Interactive appends to a packed `local` partition pay for one HMAC per fragment-sized subtree, one `INSERT` per new fragment and a zstd pass, inside a transaction that already runs projections 1–5. That is small next to the projections. Packing `local` pays mainly for full-history tenants that adopt or backfill ([0035](../decisions/0035-adopting-a-wikibase.md) §7).

`triplespace-cli storage measure --partition {name} [--sample N]` packs a sample of a partition's rows without writing anything, and reports bytes per record under each candidate: plain canonical CBOR, `lz4` alone (what TOAST would do), zstd, zstd with a dictionary, and packed with a dictionary. It also reports the number of distinct fragments, the distribution of how many times each is used, and fragment bytes per body byte. Run over a sample of the Wikidata JSON dump through `scatter-adapter-wikidata`, and over Librarybase's adoption, it answers 0058's Q1 and [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) Q1.

`triplespace-cli storage repack --partition {name} [--dict new]` rewrites rows in batches to the partition's current storage setting, dictionary and `fragments.toml`. It checks every row's commitment before and after, and runs as a writer under §3.4, so it is safe beside sweeps. `storage sweep --domain {scope} [--full]` runs §3.7 on demand. `storage pack` changes `log.partition.storage`.

## 4. The `view` schema

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §5, §5.1, §5.2, §5.3, §5.4, §5.5.*

### 4.1 The serving rule and the tenant column

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §5; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6.*

The rule for the serving model is: **the blob serves the page; tables serve queries.** A table exists only where a route needs a lookup or an order that the entity's own JSON cannot give. Nothing is normalized for its own sake.

**Tenants.** Under [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6, `view.entity` and the tables that hang off it (`term`, `sitelink`, `identifier`, `entity_ref`, `statement_assertion`, `correction`, `constraint_violation`, `value_key`) gain a `tenant text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` column that leads every primary key: the **empty string is the instance**, and the row with `tenant = ''` is the shared row computed from the shared source graphs; a tenant that has local assertions, a cluster link or a correction touching the entity has its own `(tenant, id)` row; a tenant with none reads the shared one. A read is therefore one primary-key lookup with the viewer's tenant, falling back to one with `''`. Every other table in this section is per tenant outright and carries `tenant` in its key, except a third class, **instance-scope** tables with no `tenant` column: `view.foreign_title`, `view.foreign_page` and `view.foreign_thread` (§4.8, §4.12); and `view.rdf_delta`'s shared rows carry `tenant = ''` (§4.11). The sentinel is chosen over a `NULL` tenant because a primary key cannot hold `NULL` and a plain unique constraint would not reject a duplicate shared row; no slug can be empty ([0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §1), so nothing collides. Where an earlier ADR says "a `NULL` tenant", read `''`. The SQL below is written for one tenant; the column is implied throughout. `partition` columns are `bigint`, as in §2.

### 4.2 Entities

  PRIMARY KEY (entity_id, graph)
);
```

**The resolved view is materialized only where it differs from its source.** Reconciliation across graphs ([0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §3), statement fusion ([0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §8) and canonical-ID rewriting ([0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §4) are too costly to do per request, so the projection computes the resolved canonical JSON whenever any contributing record changes. But for most entities in a full mirror, exactly one graph contributes and no value refers to a clustered entity. For those, the resolved JSON *is* the mirror record's payload, which the adapter already wrote in prefixed-ID form ([0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.4). Storing it twice would double the largest table in the database. So:

- The projection computes the resolved JSON and compares its content hash with the single source's.
- If they match, `resolved_kind = 'source'` and `resolved` is `NULL`. A reader takes the body at `entity_source.offset`.
- Otherwise `resolved_kind = 'materialized'` and `resolved` holds the JSON.
- The single source has to be a whole-state record for the reader to take it: a `put`, a `create` or an `adopt` that is the key's only local record. A local entity that has been edited with `add` or `remove` is materialized even when it is the only graph, since no record holds its state. `resolved` is compressed by the column's TOAST method (`lz4`, as §2.1 compresses bodies); the projection writes the plain canonical JSON.

Either way, a reader gets the entity with one or two primary-key lookups, and `resolved_version` is what the cache and `ETag` key on (§9.3).

**Only canonical members have a full row.** A non-canonical cluster member keeps its row for resolution (`canonical_id` points at the canonical entity), its `entity_source` rows and its terms in the per-graph views, but its resolved JSON is the canonical entity's.

**Verified providers.** The mirror record content for a `verified` provider carries the provider header and checkpoint size ([0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §2); `view.entity_source` holds them in `provider_revid` and `verified_at_size`.

**Other entity types.** `view.entity` gains rows for `WDM` as for any foreign entity ([0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4; the API and RDF halves of that section are in [18](18-api.md) and [02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md)), and rows for `L` with the resolved JSON including parts ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5).

```

- **`term` serves label lookups**, which every entity page does in bulk for the entities it links to. It is the equivalent of Wikibase's term store. Prefix search on it is a fallback; the search index (§11) is the primary path. `term` gains three term kinds for lexemes: **4 lemma**, **5 representation**, **6 gloss**, with `entity_id` the lexeme's ID for lemmas and the part's ID for representations and glosses, and `lang` the language code or variant; the term projection writes them in step 4 with the other terms, so label lookups, prefix search without OpenSearch and the term-based APIs see them with no new table ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5). Captions are `term` rows with `entity_id` of the form `M{page ID}` and `WDM{page ID}`; the page projection writes the local ones from the `terms` operation, the mirror projection the foreign ones ([0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4).
- **`sitelink`** is the form of [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §6, whose SQL the block above is; the tenant column rule of §4.1 applies. `view.registry` holds the policy records and aliases like every config kind. The denied-host filter is applied by the resolution projection, so `view.sitelink` holds only permitted links; a policy change re-runs it for the affected hosts, which the `host` index finds.
- **`identifier` holds every normalized external-id value in the resolved view**, keyed so that "which entity has DOI *x*" is one lookup. It serves match keys, tier-3 inferred links and identifier resolution in the title resolver. `match_key` is the subset under a uniqueness constraint; which properties populate it is registry configuration, and an existing violation is reported when the constraint is turned on, not silently dropped.
- **`entity_ref` is the largest table after `record`** at Wikidata scale, on the order of 10^9 rows. It is required: a change of cluster membership must find every referrer, and "Links here" must list them. Its `target_id` is the ID as asserted; the projection resolves through `canonical_id` when it reads. Statements on lexeme parts produce `entity_ref` rows as any statement does ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5).

### 4.4 Statements, clusters, corrections and constraints

```

`cluster_member`'s primary key is the one-to-one rule of [0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §2 as a constraint. A link that would violate it is held, with `status = 'held'`, and the conflict list ([0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §10) is a query on `link`.

**Subjects that are not entities.** `view.statement_assertion.entity_id`, `view.entity_ref.source_id` and `view.constraint_violation.entity_id` hold a page subject as the page ID in decimal ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §1); in `statement_assertion`, `graph` is `pages` for an asserted statement and `derived` for a projected one. So "Links here" on the item for *cleanup* lists the pages whose statements use it, and constraint reports include pages. Page statements are **not** written to `view.identifier`, `view.match_key` or `view.value_key`, so a resolver ([0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md)) or a match key never lands on a page. `view.statement_assertion` also takes lexeme part IDs as subjects, so a `statement` scope over `P5137` (item for this sense) selects senses; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §4 gains `form` and `sense` as subject types alongside `entity` ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5).

**Constraints.**

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.constraint_violation (
  entity_id text NOT NULL, statement_id text NOT NULL,
  property text NOT NULL, constraint_type text NOT NULL, constraint_statement text NOT NULL,   -- the P2302 statement's GUID
  constraint_source text NOT NULL,             -- the graph the constraint came from
  severity text NOT NULL,                      -- mandatory | normal | suggestion
  snak_role smallint NOT NULL,                 -- 1 main, 2 qualifier, 3 reference
  detail jsonb,                                -- the failing parameter and value, for the popover
  checked_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (statement_id, snak_role, constraint_statement)
);
CREATE INDEX cv_entity   ON view.constraint_violation (entity_id);
CREATE INDEX cv_property ON view.constraint_violation (property, constraint_type, severity);
CREATE TABLE view.constraint_count (property text NOT NULL, constraint_type text NOT NULL, severity text NOT NULL, violations bigint NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (property, constraint_type, severity));
```

The tenant column rule of §4.1 applies. The constraint projection runs in step 4 of §6.1, after `entity` and its dependents, and is synchronous for the changed entity's own statements. Parsed constraints per property are cached in L0 and invalidated by the property's `resolved_version` (§9.3). *Distinct values* on non-identifier data types needs a value index; `view.identifier` already serves `external-id`, and the projection maintains a small `view.value_key (property, value_key, entity_id, statement_id)` for the other data types a *distinct values* constraint names, populated only for those properties.

```

**`view.page` gains columns.** [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13 adds four, maintained by the page projection, each with an index with `ns`:

- `len integer`: bytes of the latest text, as MediaWiki's `page_len`;
- `latest_at timestamptz`;
- `revisions integer`;
- `random double precision`: drawn at creation, as `page_random`.

`is_redirect boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` is from [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5, so `prop=info` and `list=allpages&apfilterredir` need no join. **Reserved page IDs** are rows in `view.page` with `latest_offset` null and a `reserved boolean`; the title index includes them so that `create` finds the ID ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10).

**`view.actor` gains columns and status values.** `operator text` (a local actor key, null for primary accounts) and the status value `retired` ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10); the status value `pending` ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8); rows of kind `federated` with `raw` holding the remote IRI ([0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10); `last_active timestamptz` ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13). The three instance partitions `actors/{farm}`, `accounts/{farm}` and `log/{farm}` are child tables like any partition; farm accounts are rows in `view.actor` with the farm issuer, and their memberships and blocks in the tables above, with the empty-string tenant that marks the instance; nothing is new in `private`, since farm bindings are bindings and the aggregated bell reads existing inboxes ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12). The **name registry** is a unique index over the names of farm accounts and of every tenant's accounts, maintained by the actor projection when `identity.shared_names` is on; it is the farm-wide form of `actor_local_name`. Evaluation joins `view.account_link` to reach a tenant account's farm account ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §3–4); L0 caches the result per session.

**An erased actor record still projects a row.** Erasure NULLs `name` and `raw` and sets `status = 'vanished'`; on a rebuild the erased record may be the first for its key, so the row is then created with the default kind, the erased content having held the real one.

Entity pages get their `page_id` from the same sequence as document pages (§2.3), so `view.entity.page_id` and `view.page.page_id` never collide and one `pageid` space covers both kinds of page.

**ACLs and the denormalized flags.** `view.acl` holds moderation ACLs beside graph ACLs, indexed by target; the evaluation path reads it for the target and its enclosures, cached in L0, and the common case, no row, is one indexed miss ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10). Its columns are those of the SQL above, `(target, restrictions jsonb, read_kind, extra jsonb, "offset")` with `PRIMARY KEY (target)`; `target` takes the `tenant` and `set` target kinds of [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §3 as well, and `read_kind` (`confidential` or `moderation`) is derived from the right that set the record. Denormalized flags keep lists from joining: `view.page.deleted` and `view.entity.deleted boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false` are derived from `read` ACLs on the target; `view.activity.visibility` and `view.post.hidden` are derived from `record` ACLs together with the erased-parts bitmask of §2.1; `view.actor.status = 'hidden'` from an `actor` ACL.

```

`view.activity` is MediaWiki's `recentchanges`, `revision` and `logging` tables folded into one, because [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §3 already folds their rows into one shape. It grows with local activity and the number of jobs, never with the mirrors: a sync of a million entities is one `job` row and one activity row, and per-entity mirror history is served from `entity_source` and the record itself. `view.activity.patrolled boolean` with its partial index `WHERE NOT patrolled` serves the recent-changes filter, set by the patrol projection and the autopatrol rule of [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §6. `view.activity` gains `read_groups text[]`, so feed and log rows are filtered by principal ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §5, §14).

**Feeds over `activity`.** The everything, one-target and watched sets are served by `view.activity`'s `activity_time` and `activity_target` indexes, with cluster and thread expansion done before the query. A watch set of tens of thousands of targets, which experienced MediaWiki editors have, is passed as an array parameter and bounded by the period window; this is the join MediaWiki runs on every watchlist load. Sync rows for a watched mirrored entity are read per target from its mirror records, as a history reads them. Related sets are joins against `page_link_target` or `entity_ref` under the same window and the limit of [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §2. `private.watch` is small per account and never scanned across accounts ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §6).

`job_reject` holds the first N rejects for the job page ([0010](../decisions/0010-site-ui.md) §9); the full rejects file lives on disk or in object storage, and the download route streams it.

`view.registry`'s key is `(tenant, kind, code)` since [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §3 split the config kinds by scope; instance-level kinds (`key`, `graph`, `provider`, `issuer`, `keyed-type`, `tenant`, `alias`, and since then `tenancy`, `template`, `consumer`, the instance `sitelink-policy` and `federation-policy` lists, global `group`s, and `primary`, whose single code is `primary` ([0046](../decisions/0046-primary-tenant.md) §2)) have the empty-string tenant. Later ADRs project more kinds into it like every other setting: the rate-limit `site` config records ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10); OAuth consumers and `consumer-policy` ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8); `federation-policy` records, with `providers.toml` gaining `trust` (`verified` or `stream`) and the provider's key-chain URL ([0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10); sitelink policy records and aliases ([0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §6); the `tenancy`, `template`, `provider-readers` and global `group` kinds ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12); `view-pin` ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §5); `resolver` ([0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §3); `file-repo` ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20).

`provider-readers` ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §5) is tenant scope, a record in the provider tenant's own `config`, not an instance-level kind.

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.tenant (                      -- the cache purge epoch of §9.6 (0056 §7, §14)
  tenant text PRIMARY KEY, visibility_epoch integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0
);
```

`view.tenant` is a projection of the tenant's `read` ACL records on a namespace, set or tenant target, each of which increments the epoch; a tenant's configuration stays in `view.registry`.

The `view.filter`, `view.filter_hit`, `view.constraint_violation`, `view.constraint_count` and `view.value_key` tables of [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11 and [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5 sit beside these (§4.4, §4.13).

### 4.7 Page statements, categories, redirects and tables

*Sources: [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.page_statements (             -- the resolved statements of a page (0038 §1–2)
  page_id bigint PRIMARY KEY,
  version bigint NOT NULL,                      -- bumped on every change; the cache and ETag key
  statements bytea NOT NULL,                    -- canonical JSON statements, asserted ∪ projected, fused; compressed
  generation integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0         -- bumped on erasure and hiding (0014 §5)
);

CREATE TABLE view.page_category (               -- categorylinks (0038 §3)
  page_id bigint NOT NULL, category text NOT NULL,   -- the normalized name, without the prefix
  sortkey text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (page_id, category)
);
CREATE INDEX page_category_members ON view.page_category (category, sortkey, page_id);

CREATE TABLE view.category (                    -- categoryinfo (0038 §4)
  title text PRIMARY KEY, page_id bigint,       -- NULL when the category has no page
  pages integer NOT NULL, subcats integer NOT NULL,
  hidden boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false
);

CREATE TABLE view.redirect (                   -- MediaWiki's redirect table (0051 §1)
  page_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES view.page,
  target_ns integer, target_title text NOT NULL,   -- target_ns NULL for an external redirect
  fragment text, interwiki text,                   -- interwiki set for an external redirect
  target_page_id bigint                            -- resolved at projection; NULL when broken or external
);
CREATE INDEX redirect_target ON view.redirect (target_ns, target_title);
```

**Projection order.** `page_category` and `category` run in step 2, with `page`, since they read the latest text. The mapping and status projections, and the resolution of `page_statements`, run in step 4. The search and RDF projections pick up pages in step 7. A text edit's own categories and mapped statements are among its own rows under the synchronous budget, so an editor who adds a category sees the mapped statement on reload ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10).

**Redirects** are written in step 2 with `page`, because the projection reads only the page's latest text, and under the synchronous budget, so a saved redirect works on the next request. `target_page_id` is refreshed when the target is created, deleted, undeleted or moved, by the same title-index maintenance that keeps `page_link` targets current. The links projection ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §10) records a `page_link` row from the redirect to its target, so "What links here" on the target lists its redirects, `list=backlinks&blredirect` expands through them, and `prop=redirects` is a query on `view.redirect`. The title resolver's lookup of `view.redirect` is one indexed read ([0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5).

**Tables** add no table. The definition is a page record's text ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §4); the table has a `view.page` row with `content_model` `triplespace-table`; its links are `page_link` rows ([0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §8). The grid is assembled from the entities' cached resolved views and is not cached as a whole page, since any row's edit would invalidate it ([0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12).

### 4.8 Threads, talk pages, boards and foreign threads

*Sources: [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11; [0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §12; [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §10.*

Threads and talk pages get rows in `view.page` (namespace, title, content model `triplespace-thread` or `triplespace-talk` ([0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §10), latest offset and revision ID, deleted, generation), so the title index and `page_link` cover them without change. Beside it:

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.thread (
  page_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES view.page,
  target_kind smallint NOT NULL, target_id text NOT NULL, talk_page_id bigint NOT NULL,   -- the home
  subject text NOT NULL, status text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'open',
  created timestamptz NOT NULL, last_post timestamptz NOT NULL, post_count integer NOT NULL

  PRIMARY KEY (thread_id, talk_page_id)
);
CREATE INDEX thread_attachment_talk ON view.thread_attachment (talk_page_id, attached);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX thread_attachment_home ON view.thread_attachment (thread_id) WHERE home;
CREATE TABLE view.post (
  revid bigint PRIMARY KEY, thread_id bigint NOT NULL REFERENCES view.thread,
  parent_revid bigint, actor text, published timestamptz NOT NULL, updated timestamptz,
  latest_offset bigint NOT NULL,           -- the record holding the current text
  hidden smallint NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, erased boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false
);
CREATE INDEX post_thread ON view.post (thread_id, published);
CREATE TABLE view.talk_page (
  page_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES view.page,
  target_kind smallint NOT NULL, target_id text NOT NULL, UNIQUE (target_kind, target_id)
);
```

`view.thread_attachment` is the form of [0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §12 with the `pinned` column of [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §10; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11 gives it with only `(thread_id, talk_page_id, attached)`. `view.thread.talk_page_id` stays, and is the home. The listing query reads `view.thread_attachment`, which replaces the `thread_talk` index. **A board has a `view.talk_page` row** from its creation, with `target_kind` `page` and `target_id` its own page ID, so every query that starts from a talk page works on boards. These are projections in the sense of §6, applied synchronously for interactive writes.

**Foreign threads** are the projection of the followed talk pages' puts ([0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §2):

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.foreign_thread (               -- instance scope; projection of the followed talk pages' puts (0069 §2)
  repo text NOT NULL, n bigint NOT NULL,           -- page ID = provider number << 40 | 1 << 39 | n
  name_hash bytea NOT NULL,                        -- 16 bytes of SHA-256 of DiscussionTools' heading name
  talk_upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL,           -- the talk page it belongs to
  at_upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL,             -- where it is now: the talk page or an archive subpage
  section integer NOT NULL, pinned boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,   -- section 0 is pinned
  state text NOT NULL,                             -- open | archived | removed
  first_comment timestamptz, last_comment timestamptz, comments integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
  partition bigint NOT NULL, "offset" bigint NOT NULL,              -- the put that last changed it
  PRIMARY KEY (repo, n)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX foreign_thread_name ON view.foreign_thread (repo, name_hash);
CREATE INDEX foreign_thread_talk ON view.foreign_thread (repo, talk_upstream_page_id, first_comment);

CREATE TABLE ops.upstream_post (                 -- tenant scope; the send of 0069 §5–6
  id bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
  actor_key text NOT NULL, repo text NOT NULL, upstream_user_id bigint NOT NULL,
  talk_upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL, thread_n bigint, parent_anchor text,  -- NULL thread_n: a new section
  subject text, wikitext text,                     -- dropped once synced, or seven days after failing
  state text NOT NULL,                             -- queued | sent | synced | failed
  upstream_revid bigint, error jsonb,
  created timestamptz NOT NULL, updated timestamptz NOT NULL
);
```

The talk listing reads `view.thread_attachment` and `view.foreign_thread` and merges them by time.

### 4.9 Files

*Sources: [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4.*

| Schema | Table | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `file` | `(tenant, page_id, current_partition, current_offset, sha256, mime, media_type, size, width, height)`: the current version of each file page; gains `mediainfo_id` for the foreign file's `WDM` ([0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4) |
| `view` | `file_version` | `(tenant, page_id, partition, offset, revid, action, sha256, sha1, size, mime, media_type, width, height, pages, duration, metadata jsonb, visibility)`, indexed by `sha256` and by `sha1` |
| `view` | `blob` | `(scope, sha256, size, refs, readable_refs, unreadable_since, state)`: the reference count of [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §9, `unreadable_since` for reclamation, `state` `present` or `gone` |
| `view` | `file_link` | `(tenant, from_page_id, file_name)`: file usage ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §13) |
| `view` | `file_block` | `(alg, hash, takedown_id, expunged boolean)`: from `blob` ACLs and `expunge` records ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §10), read on every upload and every serve |
| `view` | `file-repo` in `registry` | Repository configuration ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §11) |
| `ops` | `upload_stash` | `(key, tenant, actor_key, sha256, sha1, size, mime, warnings, created, expires)` ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §5) |
| `ops` | `blob_delete` | Objects queued for deletion by erasure, expunge and the orphan sweep, with attempts, so that a store outage delays deletion and never forgets it |

**Projection order.** The file projection runs in step 2 with pages, after the ACL projection, since `visibility` and `readable_refs` read ACLs; it is synchronous for interactive writes, so an upload, deletion or takedown is effective when it commits. Metadata extraction ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §6) runs behind, as the search indexer does, and a version is served before its metadata is ready.

### 4.10 Reports and site statistics

*Sources: [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.report_entry (                -- 0047 §4.3: projection and batch reports
  tenant bigint NOT NULL, report text NOT NULL, scope text NOT NULL DEFAULT 'local',  -- graph set (0047 §4.2)
  key text NOT NULL, sort_value bigint, detail jsonb,
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant, report, scope, key)
);
CREATE INDEX report_entry_order ON view.report_entry (tenant, report, scope, sort_value DESC, key);
CREATE TABLE view.report_state (
  tenant bigint NOT NULL, report text NOT NULL, scope text NOT NULL,
  mode text NOT NULL,                           -- projection | batch
  computed_at timestamptz, row_count bigint,
  PRIMARY KEY (tenant, report, scope)
);
CREATE TABLE view.site_stats (                  -- 0047 §9: MediaWiki's site_stats
  tenant text PRIMARY KEY,                      -- text, not bigint: 0013 §5's tenant column
  pages bigint, articles bigint, edits bigint, files bigint, users bigint, active_users bigint, entities bigint
);
```

The `tenant` column of `report_entry`, `report_state` and `site_stats` is `text NOT NULL DEFAULT ''` like every other (§4.1); the SQL above shows it so.

`articles` counts main-namespace pages with at least one link, MediaWiki's default `$wgArticleCountMethod`.

**Projection order.** The `report` and `site_stats` projections run in step 5 of §6.1, after `activity` and `page_link`. The refresh job applies their deltas for the tables it writes ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §4.3). Batch runs and export jobs are `ops` work, beside the export jobs of §4.16.

### 4.11 RDF deltas

*Sources: [0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §3.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.rdf_delta (
  seq          bigint GENERATED ALWAYS AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,   -- the cursor; one sequence per instance
  tenant       text NOT NULL DEFAULT '',  -- '': a shared-row delta, visible to every tenant that reads its provider (0018 §6, 0013 §5)
  graph        text NOT NULL,             -- resolved | local | mirror/{provider} | metadata
  provider     text,                      -- for a shared delta, the provider whose graph produced it (0032 §4)
  entity_id    text,                      -- the subject entity; NULL for a metadata-only event
  partition    bigint, "offset" bigint,   -- the record that caused it, where one did
  resolved_version bigint,                -- 0013 §5.1, for resolved deltas
  deleted      bytea NOT NULL,            -- N-Triples (N-Quads under full), canonical order, lz4
  inserted     bytea NOT NULL,
  txn          bigint NOT NULL,            -- the appending transaction; one event per txn (0032 §6)
  time         timestamptz NOT NULL
);
CREATE INDEX rdf_delta_txn ON view.rdf_delta (txn, seq);
CREATE INDEX rdf_delta_tenant ON view.rdf_delta (tenant, seq);
CREATE INDEX rdf_delta_entity ON view.rdf_delta (entity_id, seq);   -- the erasure purge (0032 §5)
```

- **`seq` is the cursor.** It is one sequence for the instance, so every tenant's stream is a filter over one total order, and it is monotonic in the order deltas were produced, which is the order projections applied them. Consumers apply events in `seq` order and never see two events for one entity out of order.
- **A transaction is one event.** Every row carries the `txn` of the appending transaction that produced it (`txn bigint NOT NULL`, indexed with `seq`); the deltas of one transaction, an edit with its fan-out within the synchronous budget (§6.2) or one batch of a sync job, are delivered as one event whose cursor is the transaction's last `seq`, so a consumer applies an edit atomically and never sees half of it. The queued remainder of a large fan-out is its own transactions and its own events.
- **Retention is a window.** Rows older than `updates.retention` (`site` configuration, default 30 days) are deleted by a daily sweep. A consumer whose cursor has fallen out of the window is told to reload ([0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §6). This is how a Kafka-fed updater behaves, with the window as the topic's retention.
- **The table is a projection**, rebuilt from the log with every other `view` table (§6). A rebuild reproduces the same *final* state, but not the same sequence of intermediate states under compaction, and its rows take new `seq` values. Every cursor therefore carries an **epoch**, a number in `ops` that a rebuild increments; a cursor from an earlier epoch is refused with the reload response, as an expired one is.
- **A delta is never a record.** Nothing here enters the log; the stream is derived, unverifiable and rebuildable, which is what distinguishes it from the verified sync of [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) Part A.

### 4.12 Page repositories, mirrored pages, forks, shallow mirrors and derivations

*Sources: [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §8; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §8; [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §10; [0070](../decisions/0070-shallow-entity-mirroring.md) §10; [0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12.*

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.foreign_title (            -- the title index of a repository (0052 §2–3; filled by 0053 §3)
  repo text NOT NULL,                          -- the repository name; instance scope, shared by every tenant that lists it
  ns integer NOT NULL, title text NOT NULL,    -- the repository's own namespace number and normalized title
  upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL,
  is_redirect boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false,
  redirect_ns integer, redirect_title text, redirect_fragment text,
  lastrevid bigint, touched timestamptz,
  PRIMARY KEY (repo, ns, title)
);
CREATE INDEX foreign_title_page ON view.foreign_title (repo, upstream_page_id);
```

The table is instance scope, like `files/{repo}` and the shared entity views (§7): a repository's titles are the same for every tenant, and English Wikipedia's are tens of millions of rows kept once. Which tenants read which repository is `pages.repos`. `view.page` is unchanged: foreign pages have no row in it, and the resolver joins the two. A stack is not cached; its two reads are indexed. A rendered foreign page is cached as [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §4 says. The `p:` key of a local page gains nothing, since a local primary renders as before ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §8).

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.foreign_page (                 -- the bundles the instance holds (0053 §1), both modes
  repo text NOT NULL, upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL,
  ns integer NOT NULL, title text NOT NULL,
  revid bigint NOT NULL, revision_time timestamptz NOT NULL,
  content_model text NOT NULL,
  is_redirect boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT false, redirect_ns integer, redirect_title text, redirect_fragment text,
  metadata bytea NOT NULL,                        -- categories, templates, images, langlinks, page properties, sections; compressed
  retrieved timestamptz NOT NULL, expires_at timestamptz NOT NULL,
  partition bigint, "offset" bigint,              -- the mirrored-page record in mirror mode; NULL in proxy mode
  last_read timestamptz,                          -- for mirror.set = on-demand and the proxy cache's grace
  PRIMARY KEY (repo, upstream_page_id)
);
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX foreign_page_title ON view.foreign_page (repo, ns, title);

CREATE TABLE ops.repo_cursor (                   -- the event-stream position per repository (0053 §6)
  repo text PRIMARY KEY, last_event_id text, last_event_time timestamptz, lag_seconds integer
);
CREATE TABLE ops.page_fetch (                    -- fetch and put queue, deduplicated (0053 §4–6)
  repo text NOT NULL, ns integer NOT NULL, title text NOT NULL, reason text NOT NULL, queued timestamptz NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (repo, ns, title)
);
```

`view.foreign_page` is instance scope. In `proxy` mode its rows are the pages whose bundles are in the L1 cache (the `fp:` keys of §12.1), and a row is dropped when its bundle is evicted; it is the one `view` table that is not a projection of any log, which the eviction rule and the `proxy` mode's definition ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §4) make deliberate, as [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10 made the render tables. In `mirror` mode it is the projection of `pages/{repo}` and is rebuilt from it.

```sql
CREATE TABLE view.fork (                        -- one row per fork, article or dependency (0054 §1, §4)
  page_id bigint PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES view.page,
  repo text NOT NULL, upstream_page_id bigint NOT NULL, upstream_revid bigint NOT NULL,
  upstream_time timestamptz NOT NULL, forked timestamptz NOT NULL, forked_by text NOT NULL,
  kind text NOT NULL,                             -- article | dependency | talk | file-page
  parent_fork bigint,                             -- the article fork a dependency came with
  job_id bigint,
  history_state text NOT NULL,                    -- pending | seeding | complete | partial | metadata-only
  revisions_seeded integer NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, revisions_total integer,
  files_copied timestamptz
);
CREATE INDEX fork_repo_page ON view.fork (repo, upstream_page_id);
```

`view.upstream_revision` takes page subjects as [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §3 says. `ops.fork` is the job queue. `view.page` is unchanged: a fork is a page.

**Shallow mirroring** ([0070](../decisions/0070-shallow-entity-mirroring.md) §10):

- `ops.entity_fetch (tenant, provider, entity_id, reason, enqueued, attempts)` with reasons `read`, `linked`, `closure`, `event`, `sweep`, `manual`; a unique key on `(tenant, provider, entity_id)` so a busy entity is fetched once. `tenant` is `''` for a registry provider; for a tenant's entity source it is the tenant, and `provider` is the source's name ([0078](../decisions/0078-entity-sources.md) §4).
- `ops.repo_cursor` gains rows keyed by provider for the entity stream.
- The set itself is `view.entity_source` rows for the provider (`tenant = ''`); no new table.

**Derived statements** ([0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12):

- `view.derivation (tenant, source, page_id, extractor, upstream_revid, config_rev, offset, subjects)`, one row per key, the projection of `derived/{source}`.
- `view.derivation_subject (tenant, subject, source, page_id, extractor)`, primary key on all five, indexed by `(tenant, subject)`: the reverse index the entity projection reads ([0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §7) and that `GET /entity/{id}/derivations` serves.
- `ops.extraction (tenant, source, page_id, reason, enqueued, attempts)`, unique on `(tenant, source, page_id)`.

The derivation projection runs in step 2 of §6.1, beside `entity_source`; resolution of the subjects it names runs in step 4.

### 4.13 Edit filters

*Sources: [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11.*

- `view.filter (id, tenant, version_offset, name, enabled, private, scope, contexts, rule, actions jsonb, exempt_groups, hits bigint, last_hit)`: the projection of the latest record per filter key; the compiled rule is held in L0 per process and rebuilt on change.
- `view.filter_hit (partition, offset, filter_id, filter_version, actor_key, actions, target_kind, target_id, record_partition, record_offset, refused boolean, time)`, indexed by filter and by actor, for the log page and `list=abuselog`; the context variables and attempted content are read from the hit record itself.
- Filters are evaluated in the appending transaction (step 0 of the write path of §6.2, with the ACL checks), and hits are appended in the same transaction as the write they concern, or alone for a refusal. The `filter` projection runs in step 1, since the write path reads it.
- Throttle counters are `rl:filter:{id}:{key}` in Valkey with the filter's window as TTL.
- The abuse-handling store of [0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §3 gains a row per hit `(hit partition, hit offset, ip, expires)`, in `private`, under the store's retention.

### 4.14 Sets and visibility

*Sources: [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §14.*

| Schema | Table | Serves |
|---|---|---|
| `view` | `set_member (tenant, set_id, kind, id)`, indexed by `(tenant, kind, id)` | The sets a target is in, one lookup per read; written by the ACL projection |
| `view` | `read_groups text[]` on `activity`, and `visibility_epoch integer` on `tenant` | Feed and log rows filtered by principal ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §5); the purge epoch of §9.6 |
| `view` | `acl` (existing) gains the `tenant` and `set` target kinds and a `kind = confidential \| moderation` column, derived from the right that set the record | The two kinds of [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §2 |

The visibility set of a target is computed at read time from the enclosure chain: the tenant row, the namespace, the sets `set_member` names, the page or entity, and for a statement its property and entity, which is the one indexed query [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §2 already describes with two more terms. It is cached in L0 per target version and tenant epoch. Feed rows and search documents store the set at projection time and are re-projected on change (§9.6, §11.5). Nothing is added to `private`; a watch, inbox row or preference is already the holder's alone, and filtering by what the holder may read happens on the public side of the join ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §3).

### 4.15 Scopes, sprints, schemas, publications and dumps

*Sources: [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11; [0074](../decisions/0074-publishing-a-scope-to-an-external-wiki.md) §8; [0076](../decisions/0076-dataset-publication.md) §6.*

- `view.scope` and `view.scope_member` as in [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §5; the scope projection in step 7 of §6.1 and the refresh job in `ops` ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10).
- `view.sprint` and `view.task` ([0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §6); the initial computation as an `ops` job ([0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11).
- `view.schema_report`: a subject's conformance to an entity schema bound to a scope it is in ([0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §5); see the catalogue in §5.
- `ops.publication_page (tenant, publication, title, group_key, last_revid, text_hash, written_at, state)` with states `current`, `dirty`, `conflict`; `private.publication_credential (tenant, publication, username, secret)` ([0074](../decisions/0074-publishing-a-scope-to-an-external-wiki.md) §8). The routes and the CLI are in [18](18-api.md).
- `ops.dump (tenant, scope, format, generated_at, blob, sha256, members, manifest)`; dumps run as jobs and appear on `Special:Jobs` ([0076](../decisions/0076-dataset-publication.md) §6). The routes and the CLI are in [18](18-api.md).

### 4.16 The `private` and `ops` tables

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §4; [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §8; [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8; [0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §8; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11.*

Beside the `private` tables of [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §3: `private.fediverse_handle` (actor key, handle, actor IRI, inbox IRI, verified, broken, added), `private.email` (actor key, address, verified, added), `private.ap_key` (tenant, key ID, private key, public key, created) and `private.ap_follower` (the notifier's followers: actor IRI, accepted). The last two are keyed by actor, the notifier being one actor among the opted-in ones, and are read by `triplespace-federation` ([0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10, §13); under [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10 they become per-actor (`actor_key` beside the notifier's tenant row). The delivery queue for email and fediverse messages is one `ops` table, `ops.delivery`, with attempts, next attempt and last error per item. Outbound requests go through the same egress path as live upstream fetches ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §6); requests an actor initiates, verification messages and handle registrations, are rate-limited in the `notify` class ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5). The `notifications.fediverse_domains` allow and deny lists are site configuration. [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §10 uses the `ops` delivery queue of [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §8, unchanged.

**`private.api_key`** as [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §4 describes: `(actor_key, key_id, label, hash, grants text[], ip_ranges cidr[], created, expires, last_used, revoked_at)`, unique on `(actor_key, label)`. Read by `triplespace-accounts` only; sessions in Valkey carry `key_id` so revocation can find them. `docs/registry/grants.toml` lists the grants of 0024 §4 and the permissions each covers; `scatter-actors` embeds it ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10).

**OAuth** ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8). Consumers are `config` records and project into `view.registry` like every other setting. `private.oauth_consumer` `(slug, secret_hash, created, rotated_at)` holds confidential clients' secrets. `private.oauth_token` `(actor_key, token_id, consumer_slug, grants text[], refresh_hash, access_hash, issued, access_expires, refresh_expires, last_used, revoked_at)`, unique on `(actor_key, consumer_slug)`, is read and written by `triplespace-accounts`, which stores tokens as it stores keys; `triplespace-oauth` ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §11) speaks the protocol and calls it, so the set of crates that read `private` is unchanged. `last_used` is written at most once a minute per token, as for keys. Authorization codes and device codes are Valkey keys, `oauth:code:{hash}` and `oauth:device:{hash}`, with the ten-minute TTL as their expiry; they are never rows. An instance without a shared cache holds them, with the request handles of [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9, in `private` through `triplespace-accounts`, as it holds sessions, so that any replica of an API pool can finish a flow another began ([0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §13). Sessions opened with a token carry `token_id` beside 0024's `key_id`. The `oauth:{slug}` tag is in the attestation part of each record it applies to ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11); no table is added for it. Nothing here enters a header ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §3): a token, a consumer and a grant are operational state, and the attestation names the subsidiary only.

**Preferences** ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §8). `private.preference (actor_key, key, value jsonb, updated, PRIMARY KEY (actor_key, key))`. `private.notification_pref` is dropped ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §3). `ops` gains the export-job rows for large bundles. Every `private` table carries its portability class ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §2) in the schema definition. The private extract is not a table; it is produced at move time and destroyed on completion.

**Edit-filter hits.** The abuse-handling store gains a row per hit `(hit partition, hit offset, ip, expires)`, in `private`, under the store's retention ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11).

**Rate-limit configuration** is the `site` config records of [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5, projected into `view.registry` like every setting; counters are Valkey keys, never rows ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10).

Each table is specified where it is listed; this table is the index, so that the schema has one map. The first rows are the tables [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) itself defines (§2 and §4 of this chapter); the rest are the rows of [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §5.6, in its order, with the rows that the "Storage" sections of later ADRs add and that 0013 §5.6 does not list marked in the last column.

The rows marked **No** are the tables and columns that 0013 §5.6's map of the schema does not yet list.

**Two rules follow from the table.** Every `view` table is a projection under §6 and is rebuilt from the log, with two exceptions that are not pure functions of it. On a tenant with expansion on, `transclusion`, `render_state`, `entity_usage`, and the links, categories and file usage they drive are written by the refresh job and rebuilt by re-rendering, not by replay; where a render read a foreign template repository or the clock, a rebuild can differ ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10); the page properties a render sets follow the same rule ([0055](../decisions/0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6). `view.foreign_page` in `proxy` mode indexes a cache rather than a log, and is the one `view` table that is a projection of nothing ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §8). A report configured as `batch` keeps a dated snapshot in `view.report_entry`: a rebuild empties it, and the next scheduled run fills it; projection-backed report rows are rebuilt with the tables they read ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §4.3). Nothing in `private` is: the watch set, inboxes and contact details survive on the strength of that schema's backups, and two things in it are not recoverable at all, `seen` on a watch and `read_at` on a notification ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §3, [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §3). Each `private` table also carries a portability class in `triplespace-db`'s schema definition, from which the user data bundle and the private extract are generated ([0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §2).

## 6. Projections, synchrony and read-your-writes

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §7.*

### 6.1 Projections and their order

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §7; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11; [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5; [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5; [0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12.*

Every table in `view` belongs to a named projection. `ops.projection_state (projection, partition, applied_offset)` records how far each has replayed; lag is the distance to the partition's head, and it is what job pages report ([0010](../decisions/0010-site-ui.md) §9). A rebuild truncates the projection's tables and replays from offset 0.

Projections run in dependency order:

1. `registry`, `keyed_surrogate`, `actor`, and `group`, `membership`, `acl`, `block` ([0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §9, [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10), and `filter` ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11), since the write path reads all of these;
2. `entity_source`, `keyed_map` ([0009](../decisions/0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §9), `page`, `job`, `upstream_revision` ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §4), `page_category` and `category` ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10), and the file projection ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20);
3. `cluster` and `link`;
4. `entity` (resolution), `term`, `sitelink` with the denied-host filter ([0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §6), `identifier`, `value_key`, `entity_ref`, `statement_assertion`, `correction`, then `constraint_violation` and `constraint_count` ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §2), which read them, and page-statement resolution ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §10);
5. `activity` with `patrolled` ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §6), `filter_hit` ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11), `page_link`, `record_statement`, and `thread`, `post`, `talk_page` ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11), then `report` and `site_stats`, after `activity` and `page_link` ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §4.3, §13);
6. the addressing projection that fills inboxes ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §1), which reads `activity` and writes to `private`; it is the one projection whose target is not `view`, and it runs asynchronously under the notifier's role;
7. the RDF and search projections ([0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §8, in [02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md); §11.3). The **delta projection** of [0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §2 is not a separate step: it runs inside steps 2, 4 and 7, wherever a projection has both the old and the new state of an entity in hand, and writes `view.rdf_delta` in the same transaction. The scope, task and validation projections ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §5, [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §6, [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §5) run at the end of this step, in that order, within the fan-out budget.

Later ADRs place their projections in this order where their Storage sections say so: the ACL projection runs in step 1 with the permission tables, since resolution, terms, search and activity all read it, and it is synchronous for interactive writes, so a deletion is invisible the moment it commits ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10); `redirect` is written in step 2 with `page` ([0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5); the `derivation` projection runs in step 2 beside `entity_source`, and resolution of the subjects it names in step 4 ([0071](../decisions/0071-derived-statements-from-mirrored-pages.md) §12); the file projection runs in step 2 with pages, after the ACL projection ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20); lexeme terms are written by the term projection in step 4 ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5); the constraint projection runs in step 4 after `entity` and its dependents ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5); the thread tables are projections applied synchronously for interactive writes ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11).

Step 2 therefore also holds `redirect`, `page_prop` and `derivation`.

**One projection may own several tables.** The list above names tables; `term` and `identifier` are written by the `entity` projection from the same resolution pass, since each is a function of the resolved state and splitting them would resolve every subject three times. `ops.projection_state` has one row per projection, so their position is `entity`'s. A rebuild orders partitions by dependency: the `config` partition, then the instance `log` (surrogates, instance jobs), then mirrors, then tenant partitions; the resolution projection fails loudly on a keyed subject whose surrogate it cannot find ([0009](../decisions/0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md) §7).

### 6.2 The write path and the synchronous budget

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §7; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11.*

**Edit filters run before the append** ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §1, §11), in the same transaction, after the permission and ACL checks and the rate-limit check ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5); a refusal appends only the hit record. The write path in full is therefore: authenticate the credential and resolve the actor and its effective permissions, including a key's or token's grants ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §4, [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §3); rate limit; ACLs on the target and its enclosures; edit filters; the base-offset check ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §8); the append with ID allocation; projections 1–5 for the affected keys; commit.

**Interactive writes update the synchronous set in the same transaction as the append.** An editor who saves and reloads must see their edit, as they do on MediaWiki. So a write through the edit API appends the record and, before commit, applies projections 1–5 for the affected keys. Bulk jobs apply projections in batches behind the append, and report lag.

**The synchronous budget.** A write's own rows are always synchronous: the written entity's or page's resolution, terms, identifiers, sitelinks, its own `entity_ref` rows, its own constraint checks ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §2), its activity row and its delta ([0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §2). **Fan-out** to other entities, meaning referrers re-resolved by a cluster change ([0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md), Consequences), `type`, `inverse` and `symmetric` constraint re-checks of statements that point at the changed entity ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §2), and the deltas those produce, is applied inline until a budget is spent and then handed to the projection worker: `projections.sync_budget` (`site` configuration, default 1,000 rows) or `projections.sync_time` (default 250 ms), whichever comes first. The remainder is queued in `ops.projection_work` as work for the affected keys (one row per projection, tenant, record and key; `ops.projection_state` holds only positions), applied in append order by the worker that serves bulk jobs, and reported as lag on the entity page's identity line ("N referrers updating") and in `siprop=triplespace`. Read-your-writes therefore holds for the thing edited and for small fan-outs; a link to a heavily cited author shows its effect on referrers within lag. The append lock of §2.1 is released at commit, before the queued remainder runs, so a large fan-out never blocks the next editor. Report entries are fan-out under this budget; the refresh job of [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10 applies them for the tables it writes ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §13).

**Tenant overlays.** Under §7 the shared rows are computed once from the shared partitions, and a tenant's rows only where its own partitions change the result. A record in a tenant partition therefore re-runs steps 3–5 for that tenant's overlay of the affected keys; a record in a shared partition re-runs them for the shared row and for every tenant that holds an overlay row for the key.

### 6.3 Replicas

*Sources: [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §7.*

Reads may go to streaming replicas. After a write, the session records the commit's WAL position; a read is routed to a replica only when `pg_last_wal_replay_lsn()` on that replica has passed it, and to the primary otherwise; a server for which `pg_is_in_recovery()` is false is the primary whatever its replay position says, since a crash-recovered or promoted primary keeps a stale one. This is MediaWiki's ChronologyProtector, with the LSN in place of the binlog position.

## 7. Shared views and tenant overlays

*Sources: [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6; [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §5.*

Everything derived from shared source graphs alone is computed once, for the instance. Everything a tenant's own graph changes is an **overlay** keyed by tenant.

- **Entities.** `view.entity` and its dependents gain a `tenant` column (§4.1). A row with the empty-string tenant is the shared row for a mirrored entity, computed from the shared graphs. A tenant that has local assertions about the entity, a cluster link touching it, or a correction on it gets its own `(tenant, id)` row; a tenant with none reads the shared one. This is §4.2's "materialize only where it differs", applied per tenant. `view.term`, `view.identifier`, `view.entity_ref`, `view.statement_assertion` and `view.correction` follow the same rule; `view.page`, `view.activity`, `view.job` and the actor tables are per tenant outright.
- **Clusters.** Tier-2 and tier-3 links come from shared graphs and are instance-wide; tier-1 links are the tenant's own, and its `different-from` blocks are too. A tenant's clusters are the shared clusters with its overlay applied, recomputed for the entities its links touch ([0004](../decisions/0004-identity-clusters-and-equivalence.md) §2). A conflict is a conflict for the tenant that holds the links that cause it.
- **Search.** One shared `entities` index per provider, holding that provider's canonical entities as the shared view has them, and one index per tenant holding the tenant's local entities and its overlay documents (§11.4). Duplicating a provider's index per tenant is not an option at Wikidata scale, so the overlay is the only shape that works.
- **Caching.** Cache keys gain the tenant where the value is tenant-specific and omit it where it is shared, so a mirrored entity's JSON is cached once for every tenant that reads it unchanged (§9.4).

## 8. The blob store

*Sources: [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §3; [0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §5.*

**Bytes live in a blob store, addressed by SHA-256.** A substrate crate, `scatter-blob`, defines the store over the [`object_store`](https://crates.io/crates/object_store) crate (Apache Arrow), which gives one interface to a local directory, S3 and S3-compatible services (MinIO, Ceph RGW, Garage, Cloudflare R2), Google Cloud Storage and Azure. Two backends are supported and tested:

| Backend | What it is | When |
|---|---|---|
| `fs` *(default)* | A directory: local disk, a volume mounted into the container, or a mounted network filesystem | Every small instance. It keeps [0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §1's deployment: the binary and Postgres, with no new service |
| `s3` | Any S3-compatible API, with endpoint, region, bucket, prefix and credentials | Larger instances, and any instance whose storage is object storage already |

The backend is **deployment configuration**, read from the server's configuration file or environment, not a `config` record ([0015](../decisions/0015-record-format-and-partition-registry.md) §3), because it holds credentials and can differ between a primary and its replicas. Everything else about files is in `config`. The client crates are in the table of §9.2.

**Layout.** Within a **scope** ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §4), objects are keyed:

| Key | Holds |
|---|---|
| `{scope}/sha256/{h[0..2]}/{h[2..4]}/{h}` | Original bytes, `{h}` the lowercase hex SHA-256 |
| `{scope}/thumb/{h}/{transform}` | Thumbnails and other derived renderings ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §6) |
| `{scope}/stash/{key}` | Uploads in progress and stashed uploads ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §5) |
| `{scope}/cache/{repo}/{sha1}/…` | Bytes fetched from a proxied foreign repository ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §11) |

Objects under `sha256/` are **immutable**: a key's bytes never change, and identical bytes have one key. So the store needs no locks, a move or rename touches no object, deduplication is free, and two servers writing the same file at once write the same bytes to the same key, which is harmless.

**Bytes first, then the record.** An upload streams into `stash/` while the server computes SHA-256 and SHA-1 and enforces the size limit, is validated ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §5), and is copied to its `sha256/` key unless an object is already there. Only then is the `upload` record appended. A crash leaves at worst an unreferenced object, which the **orphan sweep** deletes after a grace period (`files.orphan_grace`, default 24 hours); it never leaves a record pointing at bytes that were never stored.

**What a network filesystem must provide.** The `fs` backend writes to a temporary name and renames it into place. A mounted filesystem must make that rename atomic within a directory, which NFS, SMB and local volumes do. A FUSE mount of an object store (s3fs, goofys, rclone) generally does not, and an instance on object storage should use the `s3` backend directly.

**The same store serves Scatterbase**, whose blobs are already content-addressed by SHA-256 ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §2). `scatter-blob` is a substrate crate for that reason ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §22).

## 9. Cache layers

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §1, §2, §3, §4, §5; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7.*

### 9.1 Principles

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §1; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7.*

1. **Keys name versions, not things.** A cache entry is keyed by the entity, page or record *and* the version of the data it was computed from. A write creates a new version and a new key. Old entries become unreachable and expire; nothing is purged on an ordinary edit.
2. **Mutable state lives only in Postgres.** The one mutable question, "what is the current version of X?", is answered by `view.entity.resolved_version` and `view.page.latest_offset` (§4), cached briefly in-process and nowhere else.
3. **Shared caches hold the form computed for a visibility set, keyed by that set.** The visibility set of a target is the `read` restrictions enclosing it ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §2); an entry computed under set *V* is served to any principal that satisfies *V*, so a private wiki of fifty members caches as well as a public one, and the **public form**, the response as an anonymous reader sees it with hidden fields removed and erased bodies absent, is the entry for the empty set. Only the empty set's entries reach L2 and the proxy. Administrators' moderation views, which include hidden fields and erased gaps' reasons ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §8), bypass every shared layer, as do `/account` and `/auth`. Nothing from a `private` graph is ever cached outside the holder's session.
4. **Erasure purges; everything else expires.** Erasure, upstream hiding ([0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §5), and deletion and hiding by `read` ACL ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §5) are the only events that reach into caches. Every entry also has a TTL ceiling, so a purge that is missed is bounded in time.
5. **A small instance runs with no shared cache and no search service.** The layers below are optional above the in-process cache; the code paths are the same, with the shared layer absent and the Postgres fallback (§11.6) in place.

### 9.2 Layers

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §2; [0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §5.*

| Layer | Technology | Holds | Bounded by |
|---|---|---|---|
| **L0, in-process** | An in-memory LRU in each server process (`moka`) | Registries and role maps; property data types; the canonical ID of each cluster member; labels in the instance's hot languages; current versions of recently read entities and pages; the additions of §12.2 | Size, and a TTL of seconds for current versions |
| **L1, shared** | Valkey (Redis protocol) | §12.1: resolved entity JSON, term batches, rendered pages, provenance responses, structured diffs, suggestions, upstream fetches. Also rate-limit counters and sessions. | Per-key TTL ceilings (§12.1) |
| **L2, HTTP** | `ETag` and `Cache-Control` on anonymous responses, honoured by the reverse proxy and CDN in front of the instance | Whole responses | Short `s-maxage`, `stale-while-revalidate`, purge by tag on erasure |
| **L2, web tier** | The response cache of `triplespace-web`, in each process (`moka`) or in a Valkey its configuration names (§10.2) | Public API responses to the requests it sends without credentials | Revalidated with `If-None-Match` on every use, except responses whose `max-age` the API sets because no purge can change them, kept for up to 60 seconds; never purged, so it never holds what a purge or an erasure has changed beyond the next request |
| **Replicas** | Postgres streaming replicas | Everything in `view` | LSN routing (§6.3) |

L1 is the layer MediaWiki fills with memcached. Valkey is chosen over memcached for one reason: keys can be enumerated by prefix, so an erasure can delete every entry for an entity rather than rely on generation keys alone (§9.6). Session state lives in Valkey (`s:{session}`) when a shared cache is configured and in `private` otherwise, through `triplespace-accounts` ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8); that fallback is what 0013 §4's "sessions' secrets" in `private` refers to. OAuth tokens and bindings always stay in Postgres `private` (§1.2).

**Clients** ([0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §5):

| Service | Client | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| In-process cache (L0) | `moka` | As 0014. |
| Valkey (L1) | `redis` (redis-rs) with its tokio connection manager | Works against Valkey unchanged. Prefix deletion for erasure (§9.6) uses `SCAN` + `UNLINK`. |
| OpenSearch | `reqwest` with typed request and response structs | The surface used (index, bulk, msearch, aliases, `version_type: external`) is small; a typed client module in `triplespace-search` is easier to keep current than the official client crate. |
| Blob storage | `object_store` (Apache Arrow), local-filesystem and S3 backends, in `scatter-blob` | §8 |
| Thumbnails | `image` for raster formats, `resvg` for SVG, in `scatter-files` | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §6 |

### 9.3 Versions and `ETag`

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §3.*

Every cacheable thing has one version number, and the key carries it.

| Thing | Version | Where it comes from |
|---|---|---|
| Resolved entity | `resolved_version` | Bumped by the resolution projection on every re-resolution, including ones caused by another entity's cluster change (§4.2) |
| Document page | `latest_offset` | The page's newest record (§4.5) |
| Record-derived data: a diff, a change set, a proof | `(partition, offset)` | Immutable by construction |
| Label batch | The max `resolved_version` of the entities in the batch | Computed at lookup |
| Rendered page HTML | `latest_offset`, the render epoch, the renderer version ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4, `action=parse`), and the interface language | The epoch is bumped when anything the render read changes, and the entry's lifetime is capped by the render's `expires_at` ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10) |

**`ETag` is the version.** An entity response carries `ETag: "Q42:<resolved_version>:<generation>"`. `If-None-Match` is answered from L0's current-version cache without touching Postgres when the version is unchanged. The version also appears in the JSON response body, so a client that has just written can wait for the version its write returned.

**Read-your-writes** follows from §6.2. The write transaction commits the new version; the response reports it; the write path also writes the new resolved JSON into L1 so the editor's next read hits. Replica routing by LSN covers the Postgres side.

### 9.4 Key structure: generation, version, tenant and visibility

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §4, §10; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7.*

The keys themselves are catalogued in §12.1. `{gen}` is the entity's or page's `generation` (§4.2, §4.5), which changes only on erasure or hiding (§9.6). `{ver}` is the version of §9.3.

**Tenant.** Keys gain a tenant component where the value is tenant-specific, and omit it where the value is shared, so a mirrored entity's JSON is cached once for every tenant that reads it unchanged ([0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6).

**Visibility.** Every key whose value depends on what the viewer may read also carries a **`{vis}`** segment, written after `{gen}`: a short hash of the sorted group names of the visibility set together with the tenant's visibility epoch, `-` for the empty set. That is `e:`, `t:`, `prov:`, `p:`, `d:`, `sug:`, `css:`, `post:`, `th:`, `tp:`, `fi:`, `rf:`, `ld:`, `sc:` and `sp:`; `s:`, `rl:`, `up:` and `fp:` (a repository bundle is public upstream content) do not carry it. §12.1 marks each key. A `read` ACL on a namespace, set or tenant bumps the epoch and every entry under it lapses at once (§9.6). A page's render carries the set of its own visibility, which by Rule 2 of [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §6 bounds every include.

**Stampedes** are handled per process: concurrent requests for one missing key share one computation (single flight), and a short lock key in L1 keeps two servers from resolving the same large entity at once.

### 9.5 L0 additions and the fragment cache

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §10; [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §11.*

Later ADRs add to L0 without adding a layer; the entries are all small and all invalidated by the record that changes them, and §12.2 lists them. The one with its own mechanics is the **fragment cache** of packed storage. Each process keeps an L0 LRU of fragments by `(domain, ref)`, holding their decompressed bytes, together with a set of refs known to be `shared` in the current epoch, which §3.4 uses to skip writes.

- **The known-shared set is dropped whenever the domain's `epoch` differs from the one it was built under.** Every append reads the epoch (§3.4 step 1), so a writer never relies on a ref that a sweep has since deleted.
- **The LRU drops a domain's entries on `NOTIFY ts_fragment`,** and on erasure that is the seventh erasure step of §9.6. Entries also expire after the L0 ceiling, which bounds a missed notification, as the TTL ceilings bound a missed purge.

### 9.6 Erasure, hiding and visibility changes reach every layer

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §5, §10; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §11.*

When an `erase` record is appended ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §7), an upstream hiding is followed ([0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §5), or a `read` ACL deletes or hides something ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §5), the projection that removes the derived data also:

1. **bumps `generation`** on every affected entity and page, so every existing key for them is unreachable at once;
2. **deletes the old keys** in L1 by prefix (`e:{id}:*`, `t:*:{id}:*`, `prov:{id}:*`, `p:{pageid}:*`, `d:{partition}:{offset}:*`), so the bytes leave memory rather than wait for the ceiling;
3. **purges L2 by tag.** Every anonymous response carries a cache tag for each entity and page it drew on (`Cache-Tag: entity:Q42, page:17`); the purge names the tags. A proxy or CDN that cannot purge by tag gets a shorter `s-maxage` in configuration instead;
4. **deletes the search documents** (§11.3);
5. **deletes the inbox rows** whose activity was hidden or erased, in every inbox ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §2);
6. **deletes or rewrites the `rdf_delta` rows** within the retention window whose triples include the erased ones, and emits the deleting delta ([0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §5);
7. in a packed partition, **sweeps the erased parts' fragments** and drops the domain's fragment cache in every process (§3.7, §9.5).

The end-to-end erasure test of 0014's Consequences covers all of these. A rename or vanish ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §4) bumps the generation of the actor's user pages and of every activity row's actor display, which is served uncached in any case. The TTL ceilings in §12.1 are the bound on a missed purge. An instance under a legal deadline lowers them for the duration.

**Deletion and hiding** ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §4–5) take the same path: a `read` ACL on a page, entity, record, actor, statement or property bumps the target's generation, purges its keys and tags, deletes or re-sends its search document and clears its inbox rows, because the shared layers hold only the public form (§9.1) and the public form has changed; a `property` read ACL bumps every entity the property appears on, found through `view.statement_assertion` and the resolved JSON, which is the one moderation action with a fan-out. Protection purges nothing. A **sitelink or federation policy change** ([0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §3, [0022](../decisions/0022-federation.md) §8) re-resolves the affected entities through the `host` index and bumps their versions, not their generations, since nothing was hidden for privacy.

**Visibility changes** ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7). A `read` ACL written, changed or retired on target *T*, of either kind, bumps *T*'s **generation**, as hiding does above, since both kinds of read restriction hide for privacy and no entry at any version may remain reachable; a version bump is for changes that hide nothing. On a namespace, set or tenant, it bumps the tenant's **visibility epoch**, a counter in `view.tenant` that is part of every `{vis}` hash for that tenant, so that every entry under the enclosing target lapses at once. The trade is coarse purges for correctness, and these ACLs change rarely. Both run through the same path as erasure, including the inbox purge.

**Files** ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20). Deletion, hiding, takedown and erasure take the purge path above and also purge the Cache-Tags `blob:{scope}:{h}` and `file:{tenant}:{page id}` on every media response. **Rendering** ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10, [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §6): every rendered page carries a `Cache-Tag` for each page and entity in its manifest, and erasing, deleting or hiding a dependency bumps the epoch of each page that read it and purges their tags.

### 9.7 What is not cached

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §4, §10; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §8.*

Activity lists, histories and contributions are served from `view.activity` with continuation, and are not cached above L2: their pages change with every edit and their cost is one index scan. Anything under `/account` and `/auth` is `no-store` ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §8) and never enters L1 or L2.

**Never cached above L2,** in addition: the watchlist and every response under `/watchlist` ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5), the inbox and everything under `/inbox` and `/notifications` ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §7), everything under `/account`, including preferences, subsidiaries, keys, authorizations and the data export ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8, [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9, [0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §6), all of which are `Cache-Control: private` or `no-store`. The everything feed's page and Atom forms are public and cache briefly at L2 ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5). The stream ([0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §4) is not cached; it is a fan-out from the activity projection. Constraint reports and the filter log are feeds or lists over `view` and follow the activity-list rule. The SPARQL Update stream and `/updates` ([0032](../decisions/0032-sparql-update-stream.md) §6) are range reads over `view.rdf_delta` and are not cached either; its batch files under `/dumps/updates/` are immutable once written and cache like dumps. Responses to signed media URLs are `private, no-store` ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20).

A table page's grid is assembled from the entities' cached resolved views and is not cached as a whole page, since any row's edit would invalidate it ([0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12). A title stack is not cached; its two reads are indexed ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §8).

## 10. HTTP and response caching

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §6; [0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §5, §6.*

### 10.1 HTTP caching of API responses

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §6; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7.*

For anonymous requests:

- `Cache-Control: public, max-age=0, s-maxage=60, stale-while-revalidate=300`, and `ETag` as in §9.3. Readers see at most a minute of staleness through a proxy, and none when they revalidate, because `If-None-Match` is cheap.
- `Vary: Accept, Accept-Language`. Cookies are absent on anonymous requests, so `Vary: Cookie` is not needed; an authenticated request is never served from L2.
- `Cache-Tag` as in §9.6.

MediaWiki purges its CDN on every edit because its `s-maxage` is long. Triplespace keeps `s-maxage` short and purges only on erasure. A proxy that can purge by tag may raise `s-maxage`; the default is chosen so that a proxy that cannot is still correct.

For authenticated requests: `Cache-Control: private, no-cache`, with `ETag` still present so the client revalidates. Only a response with empty visibility carries public `Cache-Control`; every other response is `private, no-cache` with an `ETag`, as authenticated responses already are ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §8). The proxy and the CDN therefore never hold a restricted form; L1 may, because it is inside the boundary ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §10).

Media bytes are the exception to the short `s-maxage`: a public file version is served with a long one, because any change that makes it unreadable purges its tags ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §7; §9.6).

### 10.2 The web tier's response cache

*Sources: [0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §5.*

The web tier may cache API responses that are the same for everyone, in its own memory (`moka`) or in a Valkey named by `web.cache.valkey_url`. The CDN in front of it is purged by tag (§9.6) and the web tier's cache is not, so the cache never serves a response the API has since changed: a cache that cannot be purged, beneath one that can, would refill the CDN with what a purge or an erasure had just removed.

- **Only credential-free requests consult it.** A request the web tier sends without `Cookie` or `Authorization` may use the cache; any other request goes to the API.
- **Only public responses enter it.** A response with `Cache-Control: public`, an `ETag` and no `Set-Cookie`, keyed `web:{host}:{hash of method, path, query and Accept-Language}`.
- **Every use revalidates.** The web tier sends the cached `ETag` in `If-None-Match`; the API answers `304` while the response is current, and a new version, a purge ([0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §14) or an erasure changes the `ETag` (§9.3). The cache saves the API building and sending the body and the web tier parsing it, not the round trip.
- **Except what no purge can change.** A response whose `max-age` is greater than zero is used without revalidation for that long, never longer than `web.cache.max_ttl`, whose default and ceiling is 60 seconds, the default `s-maxage` of §10.1, whatever `s-maxage` a deployment configures. The API sends such a `max-age` only on responses that purging, erasure and moderation never change: `meta=siteinfo`, the registries and message bundles. The web tier never honours `s-maxage`, which is set for proxies that can be purged.
- **The Valkey is held to [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §10 line 3,** `AUTH` or a private address, whether it is the instance's L1 Valkey or a separate one, and `instance check` covers it.
- **The embedded site uses no response cache;** the API's own layers (§9.2) already serve it.
- **Losing it costs only latency.** The replicas stay interchangeable.

A notice after a redirect ("Your edit was saved") travels as a short-lived cookie holding a message key from a fixed set, as MediaWiki's `postedit` does; it needs no signing and is not state.

### 10.3 A page's own cacheability

*Sources: [0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §6; [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §6.*

A page or fragment is composed from several API responses, and its HTTP caching follows from theirs:

- **It is public only if every response it used was public;** otherwise `private, no-cache`. This is [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §6 rule 1 applied to HTTP.
- **Its `ETag`** hashes the web tier's build ID, the interface language and the `ETag`s of the responses it used.
- **Its `Cache-Tag`** is the union of theirs, so the purges of §9.6 reach it.
- **It varies on `Cookie` and `Accept-Language`.**
- **A token never appears in public HTML.** Anonymous pages fetch `meta=tokens` from their components when they need one; a logged-in page is `private` and may carry its tokens in its data blocks.

A region fetched with `action=render` is cached the same way, with its page's tags.

## 11. Search

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7, §8, §10.*

### 11.1 Indexes and fields

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11; [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §12; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §19; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §17; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12; [0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §12; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11; [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7; [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5; [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §10.*

**Two indexes, one query.**

| Index | One document per | Fields |
|---|---|---|
| `entities` | Canonical entity in the resolved view: local, foreign and keyed, of every type | `id`, `type`, `provider`, `namespace` (MediaWiki number); `labels.{lang}` with `.prefix` and `.near_match` subfields; `labels_all`; `descriptions.{lang}`; `aliases.{lang}`; `key`, `key_ulabel` and `key_parents` for keyed types; `statement_keywords`; `sitelink_count`, `statement_count`, `incoming_links`; `resolved_version` |
| `pages` | Document page that is not deleted | `page_id`, `namespace`, `title` with `.prefix`, `text` (the content model rendered to plain text; with template expansion on, the rendered text, and `source_text` the source, [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §17), `content_model` (a content model registry ID; threads are `triplespace-thread`, [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §10), `origin`, `latest_offset`, `categories` (for `incategory:`) and `statement_keywords` over the page's statements (for `haswbstatement:`, [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §12), `redirect_titles` (the titles of the page's redirects, [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5; redirect pages themselves are not documents unless broken or external) and `short_description` ([0055](../decisions/0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §6) |
| `pages-{repo}` | A page a repository in `mirror` mode holds, one shared index per repository at instance scope ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7) | `title`, `text` (the HTML stripped), `categories`, `redirect_titles`, `origin`; searched beside the tenant's `pages` index when `search.inherited` is on |

Field semantics follow WikibaseCirrusSearch where a field exists there, so that its analysis configuration, its query builders and its ranking can be reused or compared:

- **`labels.{lang}`** holds the label and the aliases for that language, so a prefix match finds either. Language analyzers come from the same analysis configuration CirrusSearch uses, including the ICU plugin.
- **`labels_all`** holds every label and alias in every language, for a query with no language or a language with no label.
- **`statement_keywords`** holds `P31=Q5`-style tokens for item-valued and external-id statements in the resolved view, using canonical IDs, so `haswbstatement:` works. Properties excluded from it are registry configuration. On `pages` it covers the page's statements, so `haswbstatement:P40=Q812` finds the pages tagged for cleanup, whether the tag is asserted or projected ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §12).
- **`incoming_links`** is the count of distinct referrers in `view.entity_ref`, resolved to canonical IDs. `sitelink_count` and `statement_count` are read from the resolved JSON.
- **Keyed types** ([0009](../decisions/0009-keyed-entity-types-and-domain.md)): `id` is the prefixed ID, `domain:en.wikipedia.org`, as everywhere an entity ID appears ([0017](../decisions/0017-entity-id-grammar.md) §4); `key` keeps the bare key in its A-label form, `key_ulabel` the display form, and `key_parents` is the list of the key and every parent by removing labels from the left, so `wikipedia.org` matches `en.wikipedia.org` and a search for a zone finds its hosts. This is the DNS hierarchy of 0009 §5, made searchable.
- **Non-canonical cluster members have no document.** Their terms are already merged into the canonical entity's resolved view. A search for a non-canonical ID is a `/resolve`, not a search.

**What each page kind indexes.**

- **Threads.** A thread is one document in the `pages` index: subject plus post text, with the `Thread` namespace; hidden and erased text is not indexed, and the document is re-sent with the thread's latest revision ID as its external version ([0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11). A thread's document gains the IDs of all its attachments as a field, so a search can be limited to a board or talk page ([0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §12). Foreign threads are documents in the repository's `pages-{repo}` index with the thread fields, so a talk-page search covers both ([0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §10).
- **Redirects.** A redirect page is not indexed as a document. Its title is added to its target's document in the `pages` index, in a `redirect_titles` field, as CirrusSearch's `redirect` field does, so that a search for *Heart attack* finds *Myocardial infarction* and the suggester offers the redirect title with "→ Myocardial infarction". Broken and external redirects are indexed as documents of their own, so they can be found and fixed ([0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5).
- **Expanded text.** With expansion on, the `text` field of the `pages` index is the rendered text, as CirrusSearch indexes it, and `source_text` keeps the source. A `hastemplate:` keyword reads `view.transclusion` ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §17; the filter half of that section is in [09](09-security-and-moderation.md)).
- **File pages** are documents in the `pages` index like other pages, with the current readable version's fields: `file_media_type`, `file_mime`, `file_size`, `file_width`, `file_height`, `file_resolution`, `file_bits` and `file_text` (text the metadata projection extracts from PDFs and SVGs), supporting CirrusSearch's `filetype:`, `filemime:`, `filesize:`, `fileres:`, `filew:` and `fileh:` keywords. A version that becomes unreadable ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §8) is removed from the document, as hidden text is. Foreign files are not indexed; a local page annotating a foreign file is ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §11), with the foreign file's fields ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §19).
- **Tables** are indexed as pages, with the text of [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §3 ([0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §12).
- **Scopes and sprints** index the plain text of their definitions ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §3, [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §3); member lists and tasks are not indexed ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10, [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11).
- **Mirrored pages.** In `proxy` mode a foreign page is not indexed: its text is a cache entry, not something the tenant holds. The suggester and `list=prefixsearch` read the title index for served namespaces after the local hits, each row marked with its origin ([0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6), so a reader can reach any inherited title by typing it. In `mirror` mode a repository has one shared index, `pages-{repo}`, at instance scope like a provider's `entities` index, indexing each mirrored page's title, text (the HTML stripped), categories and redirect titles ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7).

**Other entity types.** The entity index gains lexeme documents with `lemma`, `language`, `lexical_category`, `representation` and `gloss` fields; `wbsearchentities&type=lexeme` matches lemmas and shows "lemma (language, category)" as Wikidata does, `type=form` matches representations and `type=sense` glosses, each returning the part's ID; the search box's entity suggester offers lexemes under their own heading ([0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §5). Entity schemas index their terms as any entity's and their ShExC text as a plain-text field, and `wbsearchentities&type=entityschema` finds them ([0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7; the special pages and API of that section are in [21](21-special-pages.md) and [18](18-api.md)). Captions index as the File page's terms ([0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §1, §4).

### 11.2 Queries

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7.*

| Route | Query |
|---|---|
| `GET /suggest?q=` ([0010](../decisions/0010-site-ui.md) §3) | One `msearch` with a request per kind: items and properties, foreign entities by type, keyed entities, and pages. Entities match `labels.{lang}.prefix` with the viewer's language fallback chain, rescored by `incoming_links` and `sitelink_count`; pages match `title.prefix`. If the input parses as an ID or a key, the title resolver's answer is the first suggestion and the index is not asked for it. |
| `wbsearchentities` | The entity request of `/suggest`, with `type` and `language` as given and the same continuation as Wikibase |
| `list=search` | Full text over both indexes, with `srnamespace` selecting which. Entity results use `labels_all` and `descriptions`; page results use `text` and `title`. `haswbstatement:` is honoured, and `hastemplate:` reads `view.transclusion` ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §17). |
| `list=prefixsearch` | `title.prefix` on `pages`, and `labels.{lang}.prefix` on `entities` for entity namespaces |

`list=search` and the search box run one `msearch` across the tenant's `pages` index and the `pages-{repo}` indexes of the repositories it lists in `mirror` mode, local hits first; the `site` setting **`search.inherited`** (`on` by default where a mirrored repository is listed) turns the foreign indexes off for tenants that want search to mean "what this wiki holds" ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7).

**Sitelinks and resolvers add nothing to the indexes.** A denied host's sitelink is left out of the entity document because it is left out of the resolved view ([0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §3); a resolver key is recognised by the title resolver before the index is asked ([0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §4), as an ID is.

### 11.3 Indexing is a projection

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §8.*

The search indexer is the last consumer in §6.1's order:

- After the resolution projection writes an entity, it enqueues `(id, resolved_version)`. The indexer reads the resolved JSON and `entity_ref` count from `view`, builds the document, and sends it in bulk with `version_type: external` and `version: resolved_version`. Out-of-order deliveries are rejected by the index, so retries and parallel workers are safe.
- A page record does the same with `latest_offset`.
- An erased or tombstoned entity, a deleted page, or an entity that stops being canonical is deleted from the index with the same versioning.
- The index holds no moderation-hidden data: no hidden names, no erased bodies, nothing from an internal-only or private graph. Redaction is applied when the document is built, and the erasure path of §9.6 deletes documents. It does hold content under a **confidential** restriction (§11.5).
- **Bootstrap** indexes from `view` in one pass after the resolution projection, with the refresh interval raised and replicas set to zero for the duration, as CirrusSearch's reindex does.
- **Reindexing** into a new index and swapping an alias is the only way a mapping changes. The alias is what queries name.

**Mappings.** The mappings and analysis settings are committed as JSON under `docs/search/`, versioned, and named in the alias, so a running instance can report which mapping it serves. Building a document from the resolved JSON is pure and lives in `scatter-wikibase-model` as a function, so the audit tooling can produce the same documents without a server.

**Consistency.** The index is eventually consistent with `view`, by the projection's lag. A suggestion may name an entity whose page has moved on; the page is served from `view`, and the difference is the lag reported by `ops.projection_state`.

### 11.4 Indexes per provider, tenant and repository; farm-wide search

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §10; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7.*

**Indexes multiply by provider and tenant** ([0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6): one shared `entities` index per provider, holding that provider's canonical entities as the shared view has them, and one index per tenant holding its local entities and its overlay documents. `/suggest` and `wbsearchentities` run one `msearch` across the tenant's own index and the indexes of its opted-in providers; where a tenant document and a shared document share an ID, the tenant's wins. `incoming_links` on a shared document is the instance-wide count. A repository in `mirror` mode has one shared `pages-{repo}` index at instance scope in the same way ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7).

**Farm-wide search** ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §9): under `search.farm_wide`, `/suggest` and `list=search` at the farm base run one `msearch` across every tenant's index and every provider index, each hit carrying its tenant, gated to global groups or to everyone by policy. Redaction stays per tenant.

### 11.5 Restricted content, with a filter

*Sources: [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §8; [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7.*

**Documents carry `read_groups`.** Each document in a tenant's index gains `read_groups`: the sorted group names of its target's visibility set, empty for a public target. A query adds one filter: `read_groups` is empty, or every value in it is among the principal's groups, which OpenSearch expresses as a `terms_set` query whose `minimum_should_match` is the field's length. Anonymous queries match the empty case only. `/suggest`, `wbsearchentities`, `list=search` and the farm-wide `msearch` all apply it; the Postgres fallback (§11.6) applies the same predicate in SQL.

**Moderation stays out of the index.** A deleted, hidden or suppressed target is not indexed: the moderation kind has no readers who search for it. Only the confidential kind is indexed, so a private wiki's members can search their wiki.

**Consequences for the deployment.** The index holds text that not everyone may read. It is inside the boundary of [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §10, the server is its only client, and nothing else, no dashboard and no reporting tool, is pointed at it. The per-provider shared indexes hold public form only, because they are built from public data; the per-tenant indexes are where `read_groups` is non-empty.

**Re-indexing.** A `read` ACL change re-indexes the affected documents on the trigger of §9.6, with the same versioning §11.3 uses, and a document whose target becomes moderation-hidden is deleted.

### 11.6 Postgres fallback

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §8; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §8.*

Where OpenSearch is absent, the same routes are served from Postgres:

| Route | Fallback |
|---|---|
| `/suggest`, `wbsearchentities`, `list=prefixsearch` for entities | `view.term` with the `term_prefix` index (§4.3): `lower(text) LIKE lower($q) || '%'` in the requested language and its fallbacks, ordered by a count from `entity_ref` |
| `list=prefixsearch` for pages | `view.page` on `(ns, title)` |
| `list=search` | A `tsvector` column on a `view.page_text` table with a GIN index; entities by `term_prefix` |

The fallback has no `haswbstatement:`, no ranking beyond incoming links, and no analysis. It is meant for instances small enough that a prefix scan is fast, which the profile table of [0013](../decisions/0013-postgres-storage.md) §11 (in [22](22-crates-and-stack.md)) defines. `meta=siteinfo&siprop=triplespace` ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4) reports `search: opensearch` or `search: postgres` so the UI knows which features to show. The fallback applies the restriction of §11.5 after the scan: each hit's visibility set is computed at read time ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §2) and a hit the principal may not read is dropped before paging. No `read_groups` column is added to `view.term`, `view.page` or `view.page_text`; the fallback is for instances small enough that the wider scan does not matter.

## 12. The cache and index catalogue

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §4, §10; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §11; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11; [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §12; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §5; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §8; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7, §14; [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §11; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11; [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §10.*

The ADRs after 0014 add to the layers of §9.2 without adding a layer. This section is the index, so that erasure (§9.6) and the privacy test have one list to walk. The first rows of each table are [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §4's; the rest are the rows of [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §10 and the "Caches" trailers of later ADRs, with the entries 0014 §10 does not list marked.

| `fi:{tenant}:{page id}:{gen}` | A file's imageinfo | | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20 | Yes |
| `rf:{repo}:{name}` | A foreign file's imageinfo | The repository cache TTL | 0039 §20 | Yes |
| `ld:{tenant}:{pageid}:{gen}:{offset}` | A parsed data module ([0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §6) | | [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10, [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §6 | Yes |
| `sc:{page id}:{definition revid}:{listing}` | A scope's member pages, `{listing}` being the listing version (the maximum activity ID over the members) at the last recomputation; the scope page itself follows the page rules | | [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §10 | **No** |
| `sp:{page id}:{definition revid}:{listing}` | A sprint page's counts and leaderboard, `{listing}` being the maximum activity ID over the sprint's tasks; the one hot key here, cached at L1 to absorb a busy drive | `sprints.cache_ttl` (default 30 s) | [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §11 | **No** |

Listing keys (`tp:`, `sc:`, `sp:`) are versioned like every other key: the listing version replaces the tag purges on ordinary writes, so principles 1 and 4 of §9.1 hold for them; tag purges remain for erasure and hiding (§9.6).

### 12.2 L0 entries

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §2, §10; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §10; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11; [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7, §14; [0058](../decisions/0058-packed-record-storage.md) §11.*

Beside the registries and role maps, property data types, cluster canonical IDs, hot-language labels and current versions of §9.2, all small, all invalidated by the record that changes them: the current ACLs of a target and its enclosures, including the `statement` and `property` targets ([0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §2, §10); the compiled CEL rule of every enabled filter ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11); the parsed constraints of a property, keyed by its `resolved_version` ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §5); the class chain walked by a *type* constraint check, to its depth limit ([0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §2); the farm-account join behind global groups and blocks, per session ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12); the fragment cache of packed storage (§9.5); `file_block` held whole, since it is small and read on every request ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20); a session's effective permissions and group memberships, for seconds, the subset test of [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §6 and the visibility set of recently read targets, per target version and tenant epoch ([0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §7, §14).

### 12.3 Valkey keys that are not caches

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §4, §10; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §11.*

`rl:filter:{id}:{key}`, a filter's throttle counter with the filter's window as TTL ([0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §4, §11); `oauth:code:{hash}` and `oauth:device:{hash}`, authorization and device codes with a ten-minute TTL ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8). The rate-limit counters `rl:{scope}:{key}` have the classes and windows of the site policy of [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §5 (`edit`, `create`, `move`, `link`, `job`, `read`, `stream`, `atom`, `upstream`, `notify`, `account`), keyed by actor key or, for anonymous requests, by IP; counters are Valkey keys, never rows ([0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10). Sessions (`s:`) record the API key ID or OAuth token ID that opened them, so revoking either can end them.

### 12.4 Cache tags

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §5, §10; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20; [0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §6.*

Every anonymous response carries `Cache-Tag: entity:{id}, page:{page id}` for each entity and page it drew on (§9.6); every rendered page carries a tag for each page and entity in its manifest ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §10); every media response carries `blob:{scope}:{h}` and `file:{tenant}:{page id}` ([0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §20); a page the web tier composes carries the union of its components' tags (§10.3).

### 12.5 Search indexes

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §7, §10; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §6; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §7.*

| Index | Scope | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `entities`, one per provider | Instance | That provider's canonical entities as the shared view has them; public form only |
| `entities`, one per tenant | Tenant | The tenant's local entities and its overlay documents; `read_groups` may be non-empty |
| `pages` | Tenant | Document pages that are not deleted, threads, file pages, tables, scope and sprint definitions |
| `pages-{repo}`, one per repository in `mirror` mode | Instance | Mirrored pages and foreign threads |

Thumbnails and proxied foreign bytes are caches kept in the blob store (§8), not in Valkey.

## 13. Stores beside the caches

*Sources: [0014](../decisions/0014-caches-and-search.md) §1, §10; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §10.*

Two stores sit beside Valkey in the deployment without being caches: the email and fediverse delivery queue in `ops` ([0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §8), which is durable and survives a restart; and the rate-limit counters of §12.3.

**The query store** ([0059](../decisions/0059-query-service.md) §4, in [02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md)) is instance infrastructure like OpenSearch ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §9): one store holding every public tenant's graphs under their names, isolated at query time by the SPARQL Protocol's dataset. A tenant may instead have an embedded store of its own (`query.isolation = store`), which the `isolated` preset of [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §1 selects. A private tenant has no graphs in any store ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §12).

**A small instance** runs with no shared cache and no search service (principle 5 of §9.1), with the Postgres fallback of §11.6 in place; OAuth codes, request handles and sessions are then held in `private` through `triplespace-accounts` ([0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §8). The profiles themselves are in [22](22-crates-and-stack.md).
