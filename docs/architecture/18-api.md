# 18. API

This chapter describes the programming interfaces Triplespace serves: the rules every surface follows, the MediaWiki Action API as Triplespace changes and extends it, the REST routes under `rest.php/triplespace/v0` as one table, the ingest API, structured diffs and rendering as of a revision, raw SPARQL, and the MCP server. It assumes the log and its records from [01](01-log-and-records.md), the graphs and the query service from [02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md), the serving tables, caches and search from [03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md), entity IDs from [04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md), ingest from [05](05-providers-and-ingest.md), actors, keys and OAuth from [07](07-actors-and-accounts.md), tenants and bases from [08](08-tenants-and-instances.md), and permissions, ACLs and redaction from [09](09-security-and-moderation.md). The site UI that consumes these interfaces is [19](19-site-ui.md); the web tier that routes to them is [20](20-web-tier.md). The compatibility contracts in [`../api/`](../api/) are the reference this chapter builds on and does not repeat.

## 1. The API surface

### 1.1 Rules

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §1; [0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §12.*

1. **MediaWiki modules keep MediaWiki's meaning.** They describe changes made on this instance, one revision at a time. Pywikibot and other MediaWiki clients must work without changes. Reading and editing `Project` pages remains the acceptance test ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §12).
2. **Changes to MediaWiki modules are additive.** They may add parameters, enum values and output fields that appear only when requested. They never change what an existing request returns.
3. **Data only Triplespace has goes in a new REST namespace, `rest.php/triplespace/v0`.**
   - `v0` means what it means for the vocabulary ([0005](../decisions/0005-crate-organization.md) §5): no stability promise yet.
   - An OpenAPI document, committed as `docs/api/triplespace-v0.openapi.json`, is the normative contract. The Wikibase REST API's OpenAPI document plays the same role ([mediawiki-compat.md](../api/mediawiki-compat.md) §6.2).
4. **The UI uses only the public API.** Anything the UI can show, a third-party client can show too.
   - The UI finds out which Triplespace-only features exist through capability discovery (§2.2, `siprop=triplespace`).
   - Against a stock Wikibase, those features are hidden.
5. **Every response is redacted for its viewer.**
   - Hidden and erased fields follow [0001](../decisions/0001-revision-metadata-rdf.md) §4, [0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §7 and [0011](../decisions/0011-logs.md) §5 ([09](09-security-and-moderation.md)).
   - Data from a `private` graph ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §8) is returned only to the account holder, in their own session.

### 1.2 Bases: the host selects the tenant

*Sources: [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §11; [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11; [0046](../decisions/0046-primary-tenant.md) §9; [0079](../decisions/0079-derived-issuer-codes.md) §7.*

**The host selects the tenant.** Every route is served per tenant base; `meta=siteinfo` describes the tenant, and `siprop=triplespace` names it and its opted-in providers. Instance-level routes (`/jobs` for sync jobs, the tenant list) are served at the farm base and, on a single-tenant instance, at the tenant's. The tenant list is the `tenants` array of `GET /tenancy` at the farm base (slug, issuer code as `issuer`, host, name, status), and `Special:Tenants` is its page. Mirror sync jobs are instance jobs, attested by the primary tenant's actors and listed at the farm base; local bulk jobs are tenant jobs ([08](08-tenants-and-instances.md)).

At the farm base, `meta=siteinfo&siprop=triplespace` reports the tenancy preset and switches, the farm slug, the farm code and the primary tenant's slug; `GET /tenancy` returns the policy and includes both slugs and the farm code, so a client can turn any actor key it meets into a tenant of the instance ([0079](../decisions/0079-derived-issuer-codes.md) §7) ([0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11, [0046](../decisions/0046-primary-tenant.md) §9). The UI halves of these sections, `Special:Tenants`, `Special:Tenancy` and the farm special pages, are in [19](19-site-ui.md) and [21](21-special-pages.md); the CLI commands of 0046 §9 (`instance create --farm-slug {slug}`; `primary offer {tenant}`, `primary withdraw`, `primary accept`) are in [23](23-configuration-and-registry.md). The refusals of 0046 §9 are `ts-primary-tenant` (moving, deleting or freezing the primary tenant) and `ts-no-offer` (accepting without an open offer).

### 1.3 Numeric IDs, ordering, paging and size

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §2, §2.3, §2.4; [0084](../decisions/0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §5; [0083](../decisions/0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §4.*

MediaWiki clients depend on numeric IDs from one sequence per wiki: `revid`, `parentid`, `oldid`, `baserevid`, `lastrevid`, `logid`, and `fromrev` and `torev` in `action=compare`. Diff URLs, `prop=revisions`, `list=recentchanges`, `list=logevents`, edit conflicts and the core REST history routes depend on them. The IDs are Postgres sequences, one set per tenant, taken in the appending transaction and written into the record's hashed header; the sequence increases with append order, gaps are acceptable, and erasure does not free an ID. Mirror records get a provider-ranged revision ID, `provider_number << 40 | n`; they are still not revisions of this wiki, and upstream log events keep their upstream log ID and get no local one. The sequences themselves are [01](01-log-and-records.md) §2.5 and [03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §2.3.

**Every ID a client sees is below 2^53.** Registry provider numbers are below 2^12 and a tenant assigns its entity-source numbers from 2^12 to 2^13 − 1, so `number << 40 | n` stays under 2^53 for every `n` below 2^40, and a ranged `revid` or `pageid` survives JSON in every browser and Node client, which `formatversion=2` has no string form to protect.

**`lastrevid` is local first.** An entity's `lastrevid` is the revision ID of its newest **local** record when the key has one, and otherwise the provider-ranged ID of its newest mirror record; it is the `local_revid` column of `view.entity`. It is therefore monotonic per entity within the local sequence and jumps to a ranged value only for an entity with no local history. `prop=revisions` and the history view still show mirror records in their place; `lastrevid` is what a client bases a write on, and a client bases a write on local state (§1.5, §2.5). The state of every local revision is held in `view.entity_revision (tenant, revid, state)`, written beside the record for the `local` and `pages` partitions, so `oldid=`, `action=compare`, `GET /entity/{id}/compare`, `?as_of=` and export read one row rather than replay a key's history; mirror states are not reconstructable under `latest`. The mirror metadata a `put` carries for the history view (`prev_upstream`, `first_seen`, `size`, `prev_size`, `changes`, `delta`) and the `sync_deltas` provider setting are [05](05-providers-and-ingest.md); §5.1 says how a diff uses them.

**Ordering and paging.** Lists that merge several partitions need one order that every client sees the same way.

- **Every activity row has a time and a position.** The time is when the event happened at its source. The position is the (partition, offset) of the record the row comes from.
- **Rows are ordered by (time, partition, offset).** This is a total order.
- **Continuation tokens are opaque.** Each encodes the last sort key returned and a hash of the filters. This follows MediaWiki's `continue` protocol ([mediawiki-compat.md](../api/mediawiki-compat.md) §2.6). This is the order of paged lists only: `GET /activity/stream` is commit-ordered and its `Last-Event-ID` is a vector of per-partition high-water marks ([16](16-logs-feeds-and-notifications.md) §4.4), never a sort key.
- **A sync row's time** is when it was observed on the instance.
- **Upstream edits and upstream log events** keep their upstream timestamps.
- **Imported page revisions** keep their original timestamps ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §9).

**Size.**

- **An entity's size** is the byte length of its canonical JSON in the record's source graph after the change. For the local graph, that is the local assertions about the entity. For a mirror, it is the mirrored state.
- **A size change** is measured against the same source's previous state.
- **The resolved view's size is not reported.** It depends on every source at once, and a source's earlier states may have been compacted.
- **A document page's size** is measured as in MediaWiki.

### 1.4 Normalization: which forms of an entity ID are accepted

*Sources: [0044](../decisions/0044-tenant-relative-ids.md) §3; [0082](../decisions/0082-source-form-and-the-shared-view.md) §2.*

**Every entry point normalizes the entity IDs it is given to the internal form before anything executes.** Two kinds of alternative form are accepted everywhere an entity ID is accepted on input: a tenant-relative ID ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §2.3), canonicalized as [0044](../decisions/0044-tenant-relative-ids.md) §1 has it; and **any member of an identity cluster** ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4), since the stored graph keeps the ID each source wrote and the canonical ID is an attribute of the cluster, never applied to data. A request for `WDQ42` and a request for the local `Q9` it is clustered with name the same entity. The entry points:

- the Action API: `wbgetentities&ids=`, entity values and IDs in `wbeditentity` and the statement modules, `Special:EntityPage/` and `Special:EntityData/`;
- REST under `triplespace/v0` and the Wikibase REST API's path segments;
- the change-set wire format of bulk jobs ([0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8), canonicalized during validation;
- `GET /resolve`, `wbsearchentities` and the search box's "Go to";
- SPARQL constants, which the query service's rewriting layer expands to the member set at planning time ([02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md) §7; property paths are not expanded);
- titles, and Lua and `#property`/`#statements` ([0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §8).

**A lookup by a clustered ID is a lookup over the member set.** Where a parameter names a cluster, the lookup over `entity_ref`, `identifier`, `sitelink` or `term` runs over every member, one indexed probe of `view.cluster_member` per constant with L0 in front of it; and search results collapse to one per cluster, the member the request's preference (§1.6) selects. Because two consumers of one tenant may see different forms of one value (§1.6), this normalization is not optional for any entry point: a URL copied from one view resolves in the other only because every member is accepted.

### 1.5 Refusals every write module shares

*Sources: [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §9; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9; [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0084](../decisions/0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §5.*

Every write module returns `permissiondenied` with the missing permission or grant named; `ratelimited` when over a limit ([07](07-actors-and-accounts.md) §6); and `abusefilter-warning` (with `abusefilter_token`) or `abusefilter-disallowed` when a filter acts ([09](09-security-and-moderation.md) §7). The OAuth refusals are `oauth-pending`, `oauth-consumer-disabled`, `oauth-not-allowed` when a tenant's `consumer-policy` denies the consumer, and the standard OAuth error responses at the token endpoint ([07](07-actors-and-accounts.md) §7).

**The base check is per source graph.** `action=edit`, `wbeditentity` and the other write modules decode `baserevid` to a partition and offset ([0006](../decisions/0006-log-integrity-and-erasure.md) §8). A base in the tenant's local partition is checked against the local partition's newest record for the key. A base in a mirror partition asserts only that the key still has **no local record**; a mirror advancing is never a conflict, because a mirror `put` lives in a different graph from the local assertion and cannot have been what the client was reasoning about. The one operation whose meaning depends on mirrored state, an `override` naming a specific mirrored statement, is checked by whether that statement still exists in the graph's current state, not by a revision number.

**Patching, as Wikibase patches.** A stale local base is accepted when the change set touches no statement UUID, term, alias or sitelink that a later local record touched, and the response carries the warning `wikibase-conflict-patched`, as the compatibility contract ([mediawiki-compat.md](../api/mediawiki-compat.md)) describes; otherwise the write fails with `editconflict`, and the error names the current `lastrevid` (§1.3), so a client can merge a document page three ways. A base that names a state compaction has since replaced is `editconflict`. Statement modules on disjoint GUIDs therefore never conflict. A base is still required for a wholesale replacement ([0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.2).

**`maxlag`.** The API honours inbound `maxlag` as MediaWiki does: the reported lag is the larger of replica lag ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md)) and the tenant's local-partition composition lag in seconds ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §6), so a bot's `maxlag=5` throttles it during a bulk load or a large sync.

### 1.6 The form of entity IDs in a response: `prefer`

*Sources: [0082](../decisions/0082-source-form-and-the-shared-view.md) §3.*

**A layer on the way out rewrites entity IDs to the form the consumer prefers.** It is the read-side rewrite that already turns a provider tenant's `Q6` into `LBQ6` for a reader ([08](08-tenants-and-instances.md) §4; [05](05-providers-and-ingest.md)), with the cluster map as one more rewrite table: where the consumer prefers the local namespace and `WDQ5` has an exact local match `Q9`, the response says `Q9`.

- **Exact matches only.** The rewrite uses tier-1 links (`same-as`, `convert`), tier-2 links (an identifier statement of a configured link property) and `equivalent-property` ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4). Tier-3 inference and anything a `different-from` has split are never used, so the rewrite is a bijection within a cluster and a pure function of the map: two surfaces never disagree, and a consumer can round-trip what it was shown through §1.4 without the server remembering what form it gave out.
- **`prefer` is a per-request namespace order**: `local`, a provider code, a source name, in order of preference. It is accepted on every Action API module and every `triplespace/v0` route that returns entity IDs (§3.1). Its default is the form of the IDs in the request itself, so a request for `WDQ42` comes back in Wikidata form and a request for `Q9` comes back local; the site UI asks for local ([19](19-site-ui.md) §4.2). An ID with no exact match in the preferred namespace is left as stored.
- **Where it applies:** Action API and REST JSON; SPARQL result bindings, through the concept-IRI template (§6); search results; and HTML. It rewrites the entity part of a statement GUID, consistently with the rule that the UUID is the identity ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4.9), and never anything inside a string literal or a URL.
- **It runs after the cache.** L1 holds the internal form once per entity version ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §9); the rewrite is applied to a hit on the way out, so there is one cache entry per entity, not one per preference.
- **Dumps and the update stream are never rewritten.** They are the internal graph in source form ([02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md) §6).

`wbgetentities` answers under the requested ID (§2.3), and the redirect shape is reserved for true redirects.

## 2. The Action API

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §12; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8.*

### 2.1 Modules in scope

*Sources: [0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §12; [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8; [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7; [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §9.*

Document namespaces bring these core modules into scope ([mediawiki-compat.md §5](../api/mediawiki-compat.md)):

- **Reading:** `action=parse`, `action=compare`, `query&prop=revisions`, `prop=info`, `prop=links`, `list=allpages`, `list=backlinks`, `list=prefixsearch`, `list=recentchanges` and `list=usercontribs`.
- **Writing:** `action=edit`, `action=move`, `action=delete`, `action=undelete`, `action=changecontentmodel` and `action=import`.

Pywikibot reading and editing `Project` pages is the acceptance test for this surface. Threads, boards, tables, scopes, sprints and query pages are read as any page: `prop=revisions`, `prop=info`, `action=parse`, `list=recentchanges`, `list=usercontribs`, `list=backlinks`, `action=watch`; `action=delete` and `action=undelete` on a `Thread:` title work. A definition page's content is read and written through `prop=revisions` and `action=edit` as any text model's.

The Wikibase modules accept `M` IDs as [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §7 describes, `E` IDs (`wbgetentities&ids=E1` returns the JSON of [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §1 with `type: "entityschema"`; `wbsearchentities&type=entityschema`; `wbsetlabel`, `wbsetdescription`, `wbsetaliases` on `E` IDs; `action=entityschema&text=` for the body), the term modules on `M` and `wbgetentities` on `WDM`, and WikibaseLexeme's modules with its parameters and errors — `wbladdform`, `wblremoveform`, `wbleditformelements`, `wbladdsense`, `wblremovesense`, `wbleditsenseelements`, `wblmergelexemes` — plus `wbeditentity` with `new=lexeme` or on `L` IDs, the statement modules on lexeme and part IDs, `wbgetentities` returning the full lexeme JSON for a lexeme ID and the part for a part ID, and `wbsearchentities` with the three types (`lexeme|form|sense`). Each lexeme module appends a change set whose operations address parts by ID; `scatter-wikibase-changeset` gains paths into `forms` and `senses`. Page statements are not in the Action API, except File pages', which are MediaInfo entities ([0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §13). Cell edits made with the Wikibase modules directly are ordinary entity edits: a bot can edit what a table shows without going through the table ([0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §9).

### 2.2 `meta=siteinfo`

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0018](../decisions/0018-tenants.md) §11; [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9; [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14; [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §16; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §9; [0046](../decisions/0046-primary-tenant.md) §9; [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §11; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §10; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §13; [0070](../decisions/0070-shallow-entity-mirroring.md) §9; [0075](../decisions/0075-mcp-server.md) §6; [0077](../decisions/0077-special-version.md) §10; [0078](../decisions/0078-entity-sources.md) §10; [0079](../decisions/0079-derived-issuer-codes.md) §7.*

`meta=siteinfo` describes the tenant the host selects. On a private tenant it answers an outsider with the `general` section's name, language and the fact that the wiki is private, and nothing else. Namespaces come from the registry ([0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §1).

**`siteinfo` is a function of configuration.** Every MediaWiki client and the web tier fetch it at session start, so each `siprop` is computed from the tenant's registry and settings and cached by (registry offset, tenant, visibility); no part of it counts rows or reads a queue. The live numbers that describe an instance's state are served where they already belong: the instance-wide hash-mismatch count, projection lag and the build on `GET /version`, a provider's set size, queue length and stream lag on `GET /provider/{code}/mirror`, and a page repository's index date, event lag and mirrored-page count on `GET /repo/{name}` (§3.2), all maintained as counters in `view.site_stats` and the projection tables, never by `COUNT(*)`.

| `siprop` | What Triplespace reports |
|---|---|
| `general` | `maxuploadsize`; `dbtype` is `postgres`, and `dbversion` is PostgreSQL's version unless `version.services` is `names` or `off`, in which case it is absent; `generator` is unchanged ([docs/clients.md](../clients.md)) |
| `namespaces` | `defaultcontentmodel` on every `pages` namespace whose default is not `wikitext`, as MediaWiki reports it: `wikibase-item` on 120, `triplespace-domain` on 210, `triplespace-thread` on 214, `triplespace-talk` on each enabled talk namespace, `triplespace-table` on 218; Module and Module talk while enabled |
| `providers` *(new)* | Codes, entity types, namespaces, IRI templates, whether upstream history can be fetched, and `mirror` per type |
| `issuers` *(new)* | The issuers allowed for login, without any secrets |
| `triplespace` *(new)* | Capabilities; `api_version`, which the web tier checks against the minimum it was built for ([0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §9); the REST base path; the tenant, with its slug and issuer code, and its opted-in providers; the search backend, `opensearch` or `postgres`; `theme`, the tenant's `ui.theme` token values, which the site serves as its stylesheet and which an outsider of a private tenant is not given, its landing page wearing Codex's own values; the rate-limit classes and the grant set; whether `subsidiaries.oauth_requires_approval` is on, so a tool can tell the person in advance that its account will await approval; `sitelinks: {schemes, mode, alias_count}` (no site table is reported, since there is none); the tenancy preset and switches; the farm slug, the farm code and the primary tenant's slug; `contentmodels`: each implemented model with its source, slot, format and direct-editing flag, so the UI finds out from the API which pages can change format, `Scribunto` among them, and `triplespace-table` with the limits `tables.max_rows` and `tables.max_columns`; the media base, separation and same-origin flag; `lua.ids` and `lua.client_site`; `page_repos`: each repository's name, kind, provider, served namespaces, mode, `shadowed`, `titles` and licence, as `meta=filerepoinfo` lists file repositories (its index date, event lag and mirrored-page count are on `GET /repo/{name}`); `visibility`, `security.restrictions` and, in `development` mode, `insecure`; `entity_sources`, the list `GET /entity-sources` returns; the MCP endpoint when `mcp.enabled` is on; `build`: the version, commit and `modified` flag |
| `usergroups` | Every group with its permissions, reporting `universe` as `*` |
| `extensions` | Only extensions whose API Triplespace serves. An extension is listed when at least one module that [mediawiki-compat.md](../api/mediawiki-compat.md) attributes to it is served: `WikibaseRepository` today, and `WikibaseClient`, `Echo`, `AbuseFilter`, `OAuth`, `TemplateData` and the others as their modules are built. Each entry carries Triplespace's version, URL and licence, with `Triplespace` itself as a last entry of type `other`. A client that finds an extension listed will call its modules |
| `libraries` | Third-party crates and frontend packages as `{name, version}`, as MediaWiki lists its Composer and npm libraries |
| `magicwords`, `functionhooks`, `extensiontags`, `variables`, `doubleunderscores` | From the registry ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §5) |
| `protocols`, `interwikimap`, `languagevariants`, `defaultoptions`, `specialpagealiases` | For Parsoid ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §8.1); `specialpagealiases` lists the served special pages: the intersection of the registry's `served` set with the handlers this binary compiled ([21](21-special-pages.md) §1.2), so a client never learns of a page the build cannot serve ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §2) |

Every module Triplespace adds or changes, with the parameters, values and output fields it adds, in three tables: `action=` modules, `action=query` modules (`meta=`, `prop=`, `list=` and generators), and the Wikibase and WikibaseLexeme modules. Modules offered in another extension's shape (Echo, AbuseFilter, OAuth, DiscussionTools, WikibaseQualityConstraints, CentralAuth) keep that extension's parameters, because the tools and the Wikipedia apps speak them. `meta=siteinfo` is §2.2.

**`action=` modules**

| Module | What Triplespace adds or changes | ADR |
|---|---|---|
| `action=abusefiltercheckmatch`, `action=abusefilterchecksyntax` | AbuseFilter's modules, over CEL | [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §9 |
| `action=abusefilterevalexpression`, `action=abusefilterunblockautopromote` | AbuseFilter's modules | [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §9 |
| `action=acquiretempusername` | Temporary accounts ([0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §3) | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4 |
| `action=block`, `action=unblock` | As in MediaWiki. `action=block` gains `hidename`, which writes the actor ACL beside the block | [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8 |
| `action=changecontentmodel` | Between text models the namespace allows, including to or from `triplespace-sprint`. A page whose current model is not text: `changecontentmodel-nodirectediting`. A new model the namespace does not allow, including every non-text model: `changecontentmodel-cannotbeused`. The same model: `nochanges`. These are the codes MediaWiki core gives. On a foreign primary: `ts-foreign-page` | [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §10; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `action=clientlogin`, `action=createaccount`, `meta=authmanagerinfo` | Offer a redirect-based OAuth flow for each issuer allowed for login, and MediaWiki's own `username`/`password` fields where the built-in `password` issuer is on. These are not offered to subsidiaries. `returnto` is honoured only on the request's own origin, here and on the `/auth` routes, and ignored otherwise ([0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §7). Unchanged by the OAuth server | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9 |
| `action=compare` | For document pages, as in MediaWiki. For entities, a diff of the canonical JSON of the local graph's assertions, each side read as one row of `view.entity_revision` (§1.3): the "JSON" view of [19](19-site-ui.md); the statement view is served over REST (§5.1). `contentmodel` accepts text models only; `fromslots` and `toslots` take `main` and `mediainfo`. Seeded fork revisions appear with their ranged IDs | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §11 |
| `action=delete` | Pages, threads and entity pages. `deletetalk=1` writes the second record of [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §2. Gains `oldimage` for one old file version. Addresses a redirect page itself. On a foreign primary: `ts-foreign-page` | [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `action=discussiontoolsedit`, `action=discussiontoolspageinfo` | On a followed talk title, `discussiontoolsedit` with `paction=addcomment` or `addtopic` is the same operation as `POST /thread/{id}/upstream-reply` and `POST /page/{id}/upstream-topic`, so DiscussionTools-based clients (the reply tool, Convenient Discussions) work on a followed talk page as on the wiki; `discussiontoolspageinfo` on that title returns the foreign threads' items as upstream does, with local threads omitted | [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §9 |
| `action=echomarkread`, `action=echomarkseen` | Echo's modules: `echomarkread` with `list` or `all` | [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §7 |
| `action=edit` | Text models only; any other model, a `Thread:` or talk title included, is refused with MediaWiki's own `no-direct-editing` (`apierror-no-direct-editing`), so that a bot learns at once that these pages are not text. A `contentmodel` the namespace does not allow is refused as MediaWiki refuses one its handler cannot use on the title. On a `Board` title it edits the definition (`contentmodel=triplespace-board`); a table, scope, sprint or query definition is edited as any text model's, and an invalid table definition is refused as MediaWiki refuses content its handler rejects, with the failing schema path in the message (the exact code is pinned by a contract test against MediaWiki 1.43's `json` model); the pre-save transform applies. Saving a page whose text begins with a redirect line makes it a redirect; `redirect=no` is implied on the title. On a foreign primary it starts a fork: `tsfork`, `tsforkrevid`; `ts-fork-required`; the response carries `fork: {pageid, create_revid, job}`. `tsmerge={upstream revid}` carries the `merge` field, so bots that pull can say so. On a followed talk title: `ts-upstream-talk`, which names the routes | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §9; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §9; [0049](../decisions/0049-boards.md) §11; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6; [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §11; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §8; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §10; [0063](../decisions/0063-query-namespace.md) §7; [0068](../decisions/0068-merging-with-upstream.md) §6; [0069](../decisions/0069-synchronized-talk-pages.md) §9 |
| `action=entityschema` | `text=`: the schema body | [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7 |
| `action=expandtemplates` | MediaWiki's parameters: `text`, `title`, `revid`, `prop=wikitext\|categories\|properties\|volatile\|ttl\|modules\|jsconfigvars\|encodedjsconfigvars\|parsetree`, `includecomments`, `showstrategykeys`. With expansion off: `ts-expansion-off`. Runs Lua when `wikitext.lua` is on | [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14; [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §16 |
| `action=filerevert` | `filename`, `archivename`, `comment`: writes a `revert` upload. Needs `reupload` | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17 |
| `action=globalblock` | At the farm base, with CentralAuth's meaning | [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11 |
| `action=linkaccount`, `action=unlinkaccount`, `action=removeauthenticationdata` | Manage **bindings**, the private sign-in methods of [0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §3, because that is what these modules mean in MediaWiki. They never create or remove the public account links of [0007](../decisions/0007-actor-identity.md) §7. Removing the last binding is refused | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4 |
| `action=login` | The bot-password form only, for subsidiaries' API keys. A primary account's name is refused with `ts-use-oauth`; a wrong label or secret is `Failed`. Unchanged by the OAuth server | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9 |
| `action=move` | `noredirect`, `movesubpages`, `movetalk` (accepted, no effect) and the move-over-redirect rule of [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §3; the response reports `redirectcreated`. File pages move with `movefile`; the bytes do not move, since nothing is keyed by title. On a foreign primary: `ts-foreign-page` | [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `action=oauthconsumer` | `do=propose\|update\|approve\|reject\|disable` manages consumers, under [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §10's permissions | [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9 |
| `action=options` | `change`, `optionname`, `optionvalue` and `reset`, over the registered keys, refusing unknown ones. New preference keys `ts-upstream-fold` and `ts-rc-syncs` | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §6 |
| `action=paraminfo` | Every `contentmodel` enumeration lists the implemented models, as MediaWiki lists its registered handlers ([mediawiki-compat.md](../api/mediawiki-compat.md) treats these values as site-specific) | [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8 |
| `action=parse` | Accepts the `markdown` and `yaml` content models; `contentmodel` accepts text models only. Reports the renderer version, so that the in-browser preview can detect a mismatch. Renders with expansion; gains `prop=templates`, `limitreportdata`, `limitreporthtml` and `parsetree`; `pst`, `onlypst` and `preview` as in MediaWiki; `parsoid=1` returns Parsoid's HTML where the tenant has it configured; runs Lua when `wikitext.lua` is on. `redirects` parses the target. On a foreign title: the rewritten HTML, `categories`, `templates`, `images`, `langlinks`, `properties` and `revid` from the bundle, `prop=wikitext` the source. On a table: the grid's first page as static HTML, without editing controls | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14; [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §16; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §9; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §10 |
| `action=patrol` | `revid` or `rcid`; writes the patrol event, or the unpatrol event with `unpatrol=1` | [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8 |
| `action=protect` | `protections=edit=autoconfirmed\|move=sysop`, `expiry`, `reason`; writes or retires the ACL. `read={group}` in `protections`, with `expiry` as for the others, writes a confidential restriction; MediaWiki clients that do not know it never send it. `cascade=1` is refused with `ts-no-cascade`, since there is no cascading protection. On a title that does not exist, reserves a page ID ([09](09-security-and-moderation.md) §4.8). On an entity page, restricts `edit` on the entity target (an `entity` ACL). On a foreign primary, refused with `ts-foreign-page` except create-protection | [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §13; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `action=purge` | A plain purge bumps the render epoch and purges the page's tag; `forcelinkupdate` and `forcerecursivelinkupdate` also queue refreshes. By `POST` without a token, for any principal who may read the page, in the `parse` rate class ([0057](../decisions/0057-web-tier.md) §14). On a mirrored page, refetches the bundle ([0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §6) | [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §10 |
| `action=query&export` | Export | [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §11 |
| `action=revisiondelete` | `type=revision\|logging`, `ids`, `hide=content\|comment\|user`, `show=…`, `suppress=yes\|no\|nochange`, `reason`; writes or amends `record` ACLs. `type=archive` is accepted and treated as `revision`, since deleted revisions are not moved. Gains `type=oldimage` and `type=filearchive` | [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17 |
| `action=setnotificationtimestamp` | As in MediaWiki | [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5 |
| `action=tag` | Gains the tags of [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §5 | [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §9 |
| `action=templatedata` | TemplateData's module | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4 ([0055](../decisions/0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §5–6) |
| `action=undelete` | Pages, threads and entity pages. With `timestamps` or `revisions`, the partial form of [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §3. Gains `fileids`. Addresses a redirect page itself | [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7 |
| `action=upload` | `filename`, `file`, `text`, `comment`, `ignorewarnings`, `stash`, `filekey`, chunked `offset`/`filesize`/`chunk`, `checkstatus`; `url` only where enabled. Warnings and errors as [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §5 | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17 |
| `action=userrights` | As in MediaWiki | [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7 |
| `action=watch`, `action=unwatch` | With `expiry` | [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5 |

**`action=query` modules**

| Module | What Triplespace adds or changes | ADR |
|---|---|---|
| `meta=allmessages` | The shipped MediaWiki messages ([0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §5) | [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14 |
| `meta=filerepoinfo` | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §11's repositories | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17 |
| `meta=globaluserinfo` | At the farm base, with CentralAuth's meaning | [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11 |
| `meta=notifications` | In Echo's shape: `notprop=list\|count\|seenTime`, `notfilter=read\|!read`, `notsections`, `notlimit` and continuation, returning Echo's model format. `notwikis` has its real meaning under `notifications.cross_tenant = home` and is otherwise ignored | [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §7; [0028](../decisions/0028-tenancy-policy.md) §11 |
| `meta=userinfo` | `uiprop=rights\|groups\|blockinfo`; `uiprop=hasmsg` reports an unread `talk` notification; `uiprop=ratelimits` reports the caller's limits by class (MediaWiki's shape); a subsidiary's `userinfo` carries `operator` and the key's `grants`; for a token-authenticated request it returns the subsidiary, with `uiprop=operator` and `uiprop=oauth` giving the consumer slug and the token's grants; `uiprop=options` returns the effective values with defaults filled in, as MediaWiki does | [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5; [0021](../decisions/0021-notifications.md) §7; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9; [0027](../decisions/0027-preferences-and-portability.md) §6 |
| `prop=categories` | `clprop=sortkey\|hidden` and `clshow`; from the bundle for a foreign primary | [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §13; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `prop=categoryinfo` | As in MediaWiki | [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §13 |
| `prop=deletedrevisions` | The hidden records, for members of the group only; `drvslots` as `rvslots` | [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8 |
| `prop=description`, `inprop=displaytitle` | Page properties | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4 ([0055](../decisions/0055-templatestyles-templatedata-and-page-properties.md) §5–6) |
| `prop=imageinfo` | `iiprop=timestamp\|user\|userid\|comment\|parsedcomment\|canonicaltitle\|url\|size\|dimensions\|sha1\|mime\|mediatype\|metadata\|commonmetadata\|extmetadata\|archivename\|bitdepth\|badfile`, `iiurlwidth`/`iiurlheight` for `thumburl`; `iiprop=sha256` is added. Hidden and erased fields are flagged as [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §5 flags them | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17 |
| `prop=images`, `prop=fileusage`, `prop=duplicatefiles` | Over `view.file`, `view.file_version` and `view.file_link`, per tenant; `prop=images` from the bundle for a foreign primary | [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `prop=info` | `contentmodel` for every page ID: document, entity, thread, talk and file pages. `inprop=protection` reports the page's or entity's edit and move ACLs as MediaWiki `protection` entries, and a `read` restriction as an entry of type `read` to principals that may read the page, which is every principal that can ask about it. `inprop=watched\|notificationtimestamp`. `inprop=linkclasses`, reporting `mw-redirect`. The `redirect` flag. `origin`: the repository name, `local` for a local page; `forkedfrom` beside it. For a foreign primary: `pageid`, `lastrevid`, `touched`, `length`, `contentmodel` (the upstream page's), `redirect` | [0016](../decisions/0016-permissions-and-access-control.md) §7; [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §14; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6; [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §11; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §13 |
| `prop=langlinks`, `prop=links` | From the bundle for a foreign primary | [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `prop=pageprops` | `wikibase_item` for pages connected through the client site, as Wikibase Client sets it, in Lua form; `ppprop`; from the bundle for a foreign primary | [0043](../decisions/0043-lua-modules.md) §16; [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `prop=redirects`, `generator=redirects` | The redirects to each page, from `view.redirect` | [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7 |
| `prop=revisions` | Local revisions only: the local graph for entities, the `pages` partition for document pages; `rvprop=content` at any `oldid` is one row of `view.entity_revision` (§1.3), never a replay. An erased part sets its MediaWiki hidden flag, `texthidden` for the content, `commenthidden` for the comment, `userhidden` for the attestation, and a new `erased` flag is set with it; that a record was erased is shown to everyone. New `rvprop` values: `source`, `job` and `operator`. `rvslots` takes `main` and, on File pages, `mediainfo`; `rvprop=contentmodel` is per slot; `rvprop=content` returns the serialization of [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §5. A talk page's rows are its threads' revisions and carry their content. A definition page's rows carry the definition as of each revision (a table's with `contentmodel` `triplespace-table`, `contentformat` `application/json`). For a foreign primary: the latest upstream revision, with `rvprop=content` the wikitext, `user` the upstream actor under its issuer and `comment` the upstream summary; older revisions are not held, and a request for them is answered with the latest and a warning, `ts-foreign-history`, naming the upstream history URL. Seeded fork revisions appear with ranged IDs. A deleted local entity's page answers as a deleted page | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §9; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §10; [0054](../decisions/0054-forking-a-mirrored-page.md) §11; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §8; [0061](../decisions/0061-sprints-and-tasks.md) §10; [0063](../decisions/0063-query-namespace.md) §7 |

| `list=querypage`, `generator=querypage` | `qppage` accepts the `mediawiki_name` of every served MediaWiki report, and the names of served Wikibase and Triplespace reports. A deferred or declined name is refused with `ts-report-unavailable`, which says which. `qpoffset` continues. A batch report returns `cached`, `cachedtimestamp` and `maxresults`. `generator=querypage` works as in MediaWiki | [0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §11 |
| `list=recentchanges` | One row per local revision, as in MediaWiki. Job changes carry the `bot` flag and a `job:{id}` tag. `rcjob` filters by job. Mirror records never appear; each mirror job run appears as a `job` log event. `rctype=external` is not used, because Wikibase clients already give it a meaning. `rcshow=patrolled\|!patrolled\|autopatrolled` and `rcprop=patrolled`. `rcscope` serves a scope's related changes ([0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §7) | [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0060](../decisions/0060-scopes.md) §8 |

| `titles=`, `pageids=`, `redirects` | `redirects` resolves the page set through redirects, one hop, and reports each in the `redirects` array with `from`, `to` and `tofragment`, as MediaWiki does. The page set resolves through the stack and through foreign redirects; a ranged `pageid` resolves to the repository page it names | [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |

There is no `list=threads` module; threads are read through `GET /page/{id}/threads`, whose `origin=` parameter selects local or upstream threads, and the page modules.

**Wikibase and WikibaseLexeme modules**

| Module | What Triplespace adds or changes | ADR |
|---|---|---|
| `wbcheckconstraints` | WikibaseQualityConstraints' module, in its shape: `id`, `claimid`, `constraintid`, `status`, returning per-statement results with `status` (`violation`, `warning`, `suggestion`, `compliance`, `exception`, `not-in-scope`, `todo` for an unbound type) and the constraint's clarification, so that the gadgets and tools that read it work | [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §6 |
| `wbeditentity` | Diffed against the resolved view and mapped by ownership as §2.5 says; an echoed entity is a no-op. `sitelinks` entries may carry `url` in place of `site`+`title`. `new=lexeme`, or on `L` IDs. Terms on `M` | [0084](../decisions/0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §1, §2; [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8; [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4 |
| `wbgetentities` | **Answers under the requested ID.** `ids=` accepts any member of a cluster (§1.4); a request for a non-canonical member returns the fused body under that ID, with a `canonical` field naming the cluster's canonical member and statement GUIDs prefixed with the requested ID, rewritten to the request's form (§1.6). Wikibase's redirect shape (`redirects: {from, to}`, the entity keyed by its target) is reserved for true redirects, a `redirect` operation or an upstream merge, so a Wikidata-keyed client never meets `IsRedirectPageError` on a clustered item. `sitefilter` accepts alias IDs and hosts; `sites` and `titles` (lookup by sitelink) accept both forms, and find a page's paired item; a `urls` parameter looks up by URL. A `resolver` and `key` pair of parameters, mirroring `sites`+`titles`, returns the entity when the lookup is unique and `missing` with a `candidates` list otherwise. `missing` for a deleted local entity. On `WDM`, `E` and `L` IDs as §2.1. `ids=mhc:Q1`: a source entity from the tenant's view; one not yet held is `missing`, and is enqueued when the source's mirror setting is `on-demand` or above | [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7; [0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §6; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0038](../decisions/0038-page-metadata-and-categories.md) §13; [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7; [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8; [0078](../decisions/0078-entity-sources.md) §10 |
| `wbsearchentities` | `type=entityschema`; `type=lexeme\|form\|sense` | [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8 |
| `wbsetlabel`, `wbsetdescription`, `wbsetaliases` | Accepted on `M` and on `E` IDs | [0065](../decisions/0065-mediainfo-captions-and-commons.md) §4; [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7 |
| `wbsetsitelink` | `linksite` is a site alias ID or a host; `linktitle` is a title (aliased site) or a path (host). `linkurl` takes the whole URL and needs neither. `badges` as in Wikibase. Errors: `sitelink-conflict`, `ts-sitelink-denied`, `ts-sitelink-scheme`; a title whose primary is foreign is refused as a sitelink target with `ts-sitelink-foreign` | [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6 |
| `wbladdform`, `wblremoveform`, `wbleditformelements`, `wbladdsense`, `wblremovesense`, `wbleditsenseelements`, `wblmergelexemes` | WikibaseLexeme's modules, with its parameters and errors | [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8 |
| The statement modules | On lexeme and part IDs, and on `M` IDs. On a mirror-owned statement: §2.5 (`ts-foreign-statement` for a value change) | [0084](../decisions/0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §2, §3; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8 |

The Wikibase-compatibility forms of [21](21-special-pages.md) use the existing `wb*` modules ([0047](../decisions/0047-special-pages.md) §11); `Special:ItemByTitle` and `Special:GoToLinkedPage` are served by the sitelink resolver, and `Special:ItemByTitle` accepts an alias ID and title or a URL ([0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §6, [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7).

### 2.4 Declined and deferred

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0019](../decisions/0019-discussions.md) §9; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8.*

**Declined.** `action=imagerotate` is not offered; rotation is a new upload. `rctype=external` is not used. `action=login` refuses a primary account's name with `ts-use-oauth`. **Not yet.** DiscussionTools' `action=discussiontoolsedit` (`paction=addtopic|addcomment`) on local threads can be supported later on the same records, with `commentid` values of the form `c-{revid}`; on followed talk titles it is served already (§2.3). The Wikibase REST API has no lexeme routes yet, so none are mirrored.

### 2.5 Wikibase writes against the resolved view

*Sources: [0084](../decisions/0084-wikibase-writes-against-the-resolved-view.md) §1, §2, §3, §4, §5; [0083](../decisions/0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §2.*

The entity a client fetched is the tenant's resolved view of several graphs ([05](05-providers-and-ingest.md); [04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4), and the libraries that drive this API send it back whole: WikidataIntegrator and Pywikibot's `editEntity` submit the full `claims` list as fetched, GUIDs included, plus their additions. This section says what such a write means.

**Every write is diffed against the resolved view first.** A `wb*` write, and a REST write that maps to one (§3.4), is normalized to the internal form (§1.4) and then diffed against the tenant's resolved view of the entity in source form, which is what the client fetched before the rewrite of §1.6. Content the submission carries unchanged — every mirrored statement a client echoes back, every term it did not touch — is dropped before a change set is built, so a bot write never copies mirrored content into the local graph. An echoed entity with no changes is a no-op that returns the current entity and `lastrevid`, as Wikibase's "nochange" does. The diff reads the local graph's own state from `view.graph_state` as well as the fused view ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md)).

**What remains maps to local-graph operations by who owns what it touches.** A statement, term, alias or sitelink is *local-owned* when the local graph asserted it (its UUID, or the term, is in the local graph's state) and *mirror-owned* when a mirror or source graph did. The operations are those of the change-set format ([05](05-providers-and-ingest.md); [0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8.2): `add`, `remove` and `override`, the last of which changes a rank or a term or suppresses a statement, never a value.

| Submitted change | Local-owned | Mirror-owned |
|---|---|---|
| New statement, term, alias or sitelink | `add` | `add`: a local assertion beside the mirrored ones; fusion applies |
| Changed value of a statement (main snak, qualifiers, references) | `add` of the new state under the same UUID | **refused, `ts-foreign-statement`** |
| Changed rank | `add` | `override{rank}` |
| Changed label, description or alias text | `add` | `override{term}` |
| Removed statement (`wbremoveclaims`; absent from an edited `claims` list with `clear`) | `remove` | `override{suppress}` |
| Removed alias (`wbsetaliases` with `remove`) | `remove` | `override{suppress}` of that alias |
| Replaced sitelink (`wbsetsitelink`; `wbeditentity` `sitelinks`) | `add` | `override{sitelink}`: the local link wins per host ([06](06-statements-and-properties.md) §4) |
| `clear=true` | `remove` of every local assertion | nothing: `clear` never touches a mirror graph |
| `wbsetclaim` on a GUID the entity does not hold | `add` with the submitted GUID | — |

`wbcreateclaim`, `wbsetclaimvalue`, `wbsetqualifier`, `wbremovequalifiers`, `wbsetreference`, `wbremovereferences`, `wbsetlabel`, `wbsetdescription`, `wbsetaliases`, `wbsetsitelink`, `wblinktitles`, `wbmergeitems` and `wbcreateredirect` each reduce to one or more rows of this table, as do the lexeme modules on a part and the `M`-entity term modules. `wbmergeitems` between a local and a mirrored item is a `same-as` ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4), never a copy; between two foreign entities it is a `redirect` ([21](21-special-pages.md) §3.1). `clear=true` is therefore safe on a fused entity: it cannot remove mirrored content.

**A value change on a mirror-owned statement is refused** with `ts-foreign-statement`, naming the statement's graph and the two things the client can do instead: suppress it and add its own (`override{suppress}` plus `add`, which the statement UI offers as one action, [19](19-site-ui.md) §4.7), or propose the change upstream ([14](14-discussions.md); [17](17-federation-and-publication.md) §3). Silently suppressing and re-adding under a new GUID would leave the client holding a GUID that no longer exists and bend the rule that the UUID is the identity ([04](04-entities-and-identifiers.md) §4.9); the refusal is honest, and the libraries surface the code. Projected page statements keep their own refusal, `ts-derived-statement` (§3.2).

**The response is the recomposed entity.** The write response carries the entity composed again after commit, inline for the written entity so that read-your-writes holds ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §6), rewritten to the request's form (§1.6), with `lastrevid` as §1.3 defines it. It is the stored entity, not the base plus the change, so the compatibility contract's quirk (a patched `wbeditentity` response missing concurrent additions) does not apply here. The base check, patching and `maxlag` are §1.5.

The three client libraries are the acceptance test of this section: `editEntity` with an echoed entity is a no-op; a run that adds statements to actively edited Wikidata items never fails on `editconflict` because the mirror advanced; and a value change on a mirrored statement fails with a code the libraries show.

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §9.*

### 3.1 Conventions the routes share

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5; [0020](../decisions/0020-change-feeds.md) §5; [0023](../decisions/0023-moderation.md) §8; [0024](../decisions/0024-subsidiary-accounts.md) §8; [0030](../decisions/0030-edit-filters.md) §9; [0039](../decisions/0039-files-and-media.md) §17; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §9; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0052](../decisions/0052-page-repositories-and-title-inheritance.md) §6; [0056](../decisions/0056-security-model.md) §13; [0031](../decisions/0031-property-constraints.md) §6; [0082](../decisions/0082-source-form-and-the-shared-view.md) §2, §3.*

**Every route is served per tenant base,** which the host selects; instance-level routes are served at the farm base and, on a single-tenant instance, at the tenant's as well (§1.2). The OpenAPI document of §1.1 is the contract.

**Entity IDs.** Every path segment and parameter that takes an entity ID accepts any member of its cluster and any tenant-relative form (§1.4), and every route that returns entity IDs accepts `prefer`, the namespace order of §1.6, defaulting to the form of the IDs in the request; the rewrite runs after the cache, on the way out.

**Page summaries.** A page summary (`GET /page/{id}` and the routes that embed one) carries `content_model` for every page and, for File pages, `mediainfo_id`; `redirect_to` for a redirect; and `origin`, `upstream` (page ID, revision, URL) and `stack` (every origin under the title, in order, with `shown: true` or `false`), with a provider-ranged ID accepted for a foreign page.

**Activity rows.** The activity row ([16](16-logs-feeds-and-notifications.md)) gains `patrolled`, and its `visibility` field already reports hidden parts; it gains `filters`, the filters a record matched with their actions, for rows the viewer may see. The provenance response gains a `constraints` list per statement, so the statement UI needs one request, not two.

**Visibility.** `GET /acl/{kind}/{id}` on any target also returns `visibility`, the resolved set, to a principal that may read the target. Every response is redacted for its viewer; a `read` ACL is one more input to that redaction, and nothing behind a `read` ACL is returned to a viewer outside its group, from any route, cache or index ([09](09-security-and-moderation.md) §5).

**Caching.** Watchlist responses carry `Cache-Control: private` and never enter the shared caches; the everything feed's page and Atom forms are public and cache briefly at L2. `/account/subsidiaries` is `no-store` like everything under `/account`; no route returns a key's hash, and no route but the issuing `POST` returns a secret. No URL, thumbnail URL, hash or metadata of a file version the viewer may not read is returned by any route, and no media route serves its bytes ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §10). When each binding was last used is stored in the operational store, never in the log.

Every route under `rest.php/triplespace/v0`, sorted by path.

The bulk-job submission endpoint is unchanged (§4). The MCP endpoint `{base}/mcp` is outside `rest.php` (§7). The ActivityPub endpoints and WebFinger are outside `triplespace/v0`, at the paths ActivityPub and WebFinger fix, for each actor kind ([17](17-federation-and-publication.md)).

Every `/scope/` route addresses a scope by page ID, the dataset and dump routes included.

The farm-base global group and block interface is the Action API — `action=globalblock`, `list=globalblocks` and the global-group modules (§2.3) — and no REST route; the catalogue has no row for one.

This table is the one index of the routes later ADRs added; [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5 links to it.

### 3.3 `GET /resolve`

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5; [0029](../decisions/0029-resolver-namespaces.md) §6; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0078](../decisions/0078-entity-sources.md) §10.*

`GET /resolve?q=` resolves any string to its canonical page through the title resolver ([10](10-pages-and-content-models.md)). It tries, in order: entity IDs such as `WDQ65`, source IDs among them (`mhc:Q1`, answered with `kind: entity-source`); keyed-type IDs; notation keys ([0048](../decisions/0048-notation.md) §2); then resolver-prefixed strings (`doi:10.1000/xyz`) and bare strings that normalize to a valid key of exactly one resolver; and last main-namespace titles, so that a bare ID still reaches its entity first, and a main-namespace page with the same title is returned in an `also` field. For a resolver match the response carries `kind: resolver`, the resolver, the normalized key and either the target entity or the candidate list. It reports `redirected_from` when it followed a redirect. A string that normalizes to a notation key ([0048](../decisions/0048-notation.md) §2) resolves, as the exception to the bare-key rule; any other bare string that normalizes to a key of some keyed type, such as a domain name, is offered as a suggestion, since bare keys are not IDs ([0017](../decisions/0017-entity-id-grammar.md) §1).

### 3.4 MediaWiki core REST and the Wikibase REST API

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4; [0026](../decisions/0026-sitelinks.md) §7; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §9; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §12; [0044](../decisions/0044-tenant-relative-ids.md) §3; [0051](../decisions/0051-page-redirects.md) §7; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8.*

The MediaWiki core and Wikibase REST APIs keep MediaWiki's meaning. Core REST `/v1/page/{title}/history` lists local revisions only, as `prop=revisions` does. Page objects in MediaWiki REST's shape (`GET /v1/page/{title}/bare` and its relatives) carry `content_model` for every page, as MediaWiki's do. `GET /v1/page/{title}` and relatives follow one redirect hop, with `redirect=no` to stop, answering as MediaWiki REST does. `/v1/revision/{id}/html` renders an old revision with the templates as they are now. The Wikibase REST API's `/entities/items/{id}/sitelinks/{site_id}` accepts alias IDs and hosts, and its path segments accept tenant-relative IDs. The Wikibase REST API has no lexeme routes yet, so none are mirrored. `GET /file/{title}` under `triplespace/v0` uses MediaWiki REST's `v1/file` shape.

## 4. The ingest API

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §5; [0044](../decisions/0044-tenant-relative-ids.md) §3; [0045](../decisions/0045-table-content-model.md) §10; [0066](../decisions/0066-lexemes.md) §8.*

The change-set format and its three entry points, among them the HTTP bulk-job endpoint, are [0002](../decisions/0002-source-graphs-and-mass-ingest.md) §8 and [05](05-providers-and-ingest.md). The bulk-job submission endpoint is unchanged by the routes of §3; the job routes of §3.2 (`/jobs`, `/jobs/{id}` and its `changes`, `rejects`, `events`, `revert` and `rerun`) report on and control the jobs it starts. Tenant-relative IDs in the wire format are canonicalized during validation. Routes that write on an entity's or page's behalf map to the same change sets: `POST /table/{pageid}/rows/{id}` maps one row's cell edits to one change set, and each lexeme module appends a change set whose operations address parts by ID.

## 5. Diffs and rendering as of a revision

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §7; [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §12.*

### 5.1 Structured diffs

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §7, §2, §4; [0083](../decisions/0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §4.*

`GET /entity/{id}/changes/{partition}/{offset}` returns the structured diff of one change set: the statement view of [0010](../decisions/0010-site-ui.md) §6, which `action=compare` does not give ([0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §4). A diff response holds:

- **The change set's operations,** as stored.
- **Before and after, as statement groups.** For each property the change touched, the group in canonical JSON before and after the change, with the neighbouring values for context. "Before" is the source graph's state just before the record: for the local graph, the `view.entity_revision` row of the previous local revision, and "after" the row of this one (§1.3), so a diff reads two rows and replays nothing; for a mirror, the previous and the new `put`, where the history policy kept them. Terms and sitelinks are returned as keyed lists.
- **An effect block,** in three parts:
  - `resolved`: the groups and values that changed in the resolved view;
  - `truthy`: the truthy triples added and removed;
  - `upstream`: whether anything was written upstream, and the correction's state.
- **An integrity block:** the record's coordinates and the checkpoint that includes it.

**The effect is computed against the other sources as they are now,** and labelled that way. Their earlier states may have been compacted, so the resolved view at the time of the change cannot, in general, be rebuilt.

**For a sync,** the diff comes from `delta` where it was stored, which is only when the provider's registry entry sets `sync_deltas: full`. Otherwise it comes from `changes`, the per-property summary of counts added, removed and changed, with a link to the provider's own diff between `prev_upstream` and the new version; for Wikidata, that is `index.php?diff={new}&oldid={prev}`. The default is `sync_deltas: summary`. In bootstrap mode these fields are empty ([05](05-providers-and-ingest.md)).

### 5.2 Rendering a revision as of its time

*Sources: [0042](../decisions/0042-template-expansion-and-parsoid.md) §12; [0053](../decisions/0053-mirrored-pages.md) §10; [0083](../decisions/0083-write-path-in-three-tiers.md) §4.*

**The Action API and MediaWiki's REST API keep MediaWiki's meaning:** `action=parse&oldid=` and `/v1/revision/{id}/html` render an old revision with the templates as they are now.

**`triplespace/v0` adds what an append-only log makes possible:** `GET /page/{id}/html?revision={revid}&as_of=revision` renders the revision with every local page it depends on **as of the revision's offset**.

- Local pages are exact, since every revision is in the log, and each is one row of `view.entity_revision` for the `pages` partition (§1.3).
- Entities' local-graph states as of that offset are exact for the same reason; their mirrored contributions are current, since mirror states are not reconstructable under `latest`.
- Foreign repositories are current.

The response says which, with `as_of_exact`. An exact response is immutable and caches as record-derived data does ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §9). For a foreign page, `as_of` is refused with `ts-foreign-history`.

## 6. Raw SPARQL for people

*Sources: [0059](../decisions/0059-query-service.md) §6; [0063](../decisions/0063-query-namespace.md) §7; [0062](../decisions/0062-workspaces.md) §8; [0064](../decisions/0064-entityschema-and-validation.md) §7.*

**`GET` and `POST /sparql`**, at the tenant base, implement the SPARQL 1.1 Protocol for queries: `query=`, result formats `application/sparql-results+json` (default), `+xml`, `text/csv`, `text/tab-separated-values`, and for `CONSTRUCT`/`DESCRIBE` the RDF formats `triplespace-rdf` already writes. The dataset is the tenant's ([02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md) §7, [08](08-tenants-and-instances.md) §9); `FROM` is refused; `SERVICE` is refused in version 1; Update is not served, as the protocol's update operation is simply absent. `query.timeout` (default 30 s) and `query.max_results` (default 100,000 solutions) bound every query, and a result cut at either says so in a `Query-Truncated: timeout | results` header, since the result formats have no place for a warning. The response carries `Query-Cursor: {epoch}:{seq}`.

**Prefixes.** The prefixes of the Wikibase-compatible dump ([wikibase-compat.md](../api/wikibase-compat.md) §4) are pre-declared, with the tenant's own `wd:`, `wdt:`, `p:`, `ps:`, `pq:` and the rest bound to the tenant's IRIs, as the Wikidata Query Service pre-declares Wikidata's; a query may redeclare any of them. The prefix set is served at `GET /sparql/prefixes` as Turtle, so that a client can show it.

**A private tenant keeps its query service.** On a tenant whose visibility is restricted ([09](09-security-and-moderation.md) §1), `/sparql` is served with `query.isolation = store` to every principal that satisfies the tenant's `tenant` ACL, from a store that holds that tenant's graphs alone ([08](08-tenants-and-instances.md) §9); what such a tenant lacks is the anonymous endpoint, `GET /updates/stream` and the dumps, since those are ∅-form by construction ([02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md) §6). `Special:Query` ([21](21-special-pages.md) §6.1) is served there on the same terms.

**Rate limits**: a class, `query`, 30 / 300 per minute (`user` / `bot`), counting queries started; a subsidiary that needs more asks for it as any does ([07](07-actors-and-accounts.md) §6). Concurrency is bounded instance-wide by `query.max_concurrent` (default 8), beyond which a query waits up to its own timeout. **Permission**: `read`. **Caching**: a `GET /sparql` response is cacheable at L2 for `query.cache_ttl` (default 60 s) by its full URL, since the store holds public form only and the dataset is a function of the tenant; `POST` is not cached.

The same class, limits and headers govern `GET /query/{pageid}/run`, `POST /scope/preview`, `POST /scope/{pageid}/refresh` and `POST /schema/{id}/check` (§3.2). `Special:Query`, the editor over `/sparql`, is [21](21-special-pages.md); it reads nothing but `/sparql`.

## 7. The MCP server

*Sources: [0075](../decisions/0075-mcp-server.md) §1, §2, §3, §4, §6.*

### 7.1 One endpoint per tenant

*Sources: [0075](../decisions/0075-mcp-server.md) §1, §6.*

**Each tenant with `mcp.enabled` serves MCP at `{base}/mcp`**, over the protocol's Streamable HTTP transport, from `triplespace-server` like every other API surface ([0033](../decisions/0033-backend-stack.md) §3). `mcp.enabled` is a `site` setting, default off; `mcp.scope`, `mcp.scopes`, `mcp.facets`, `mcp.instructions` and `mcp.max_results` are `site` settings with it ([23](23-configuration-and-registry.md)). `meta=siteinfo&siprop=triplespace` reports the endpoint when enabled, and the REST root lists it, so a client that knows the wiki can find the server.

**A default scope narrows every tool.** `mcp.scope` names the scope the tools search within by default; `mcp.scopes` lists other scopes a client may select per session with `?scope={title}` on the endpoint URL. With no scope, the tools range over the tenant's resolved view.

### 7.2 Tools, read-only

*Sources: [0075](../decisions/0075-mcp-server.md) §2.*

| Tool | Answers | Backed by |
|---|---|---|
| `search` | Entities by name in a language, with labels, descriptions and match type | The search index ([03](03-storage-caches-and-search.md) §11), as `wbsearchentities` |
| `get_entity` | One entity: labels, descriptions, statements with property and value labels, identifiers with their URLs, and the canonical IRI | The resolved view |
| `find` | Entities in the scope matching filters: `{property, value}`, `{property, values}` (any of), `{property, from, to}` for times and quantities, and `{path}` for transitive paths as [0074](../decisions/0074-publishing-a-scope-to-an-external-wiki.md) §2 writes them; paged by cursor | A compiled query ([02](02-graphs-rdf-and-query.md) §7.4) over the scope |
| `facets` | For a filter, the values of the configured facet properties among the matches, with counts | `/scope/{id}/facets` |
| `mentions` | The pages an entity was derived from, with the lines that mention it | `GET /entity/{id}/derivations` |
| `run_query` | A saved `Query:` page by title, with its parameters | [0063](../decisions/0063-query-namespace.md) |
| `sparql` | A SELECT query, under the query service's limits | `/sparql` (§6) |

Every result carries labels in the language the client asks for (`lang`, default the tenant's content language), the canonical IRI of every entity, and the URL of every page. `find`, `facets`, `run_query` and `sparql` need the query service; on a tenant without one, the server lists only `search`, `get_entity` and `mentions`.

**Not yet.** No tool writes in this version.

### 7.3 Vocabulary and resources

*Sources: [0075](../decisions/0075-mcp-server.md) §3, §4.*

**An agent learns which properties matter from the server, not from the property list.**

- **`mcp.facets`** lists the properties offered as filters and facets, each with a short description written for the agent ("record type: the kind of records a resource holds, such as probate or census"). The descriptions of `find` and `facets` are generated from it, with the properties' labels and IDs.
- **`mcp.instructions`** is free text returned as the server's instructions at initialization: what the tenant holds, what a typical question looks like, what the facets mean.

The server exposes, as MCP resources:

- each scope it serves: its description, size, facet properties, and the URLs of its dumps ([17](17-federation-and-publication.md)), so that an agent that wants everything downloads a dump instead of paging `find`;
- the facet property list, with each property's data type and, for items, its most common values.

Access control for the server is [09](09-security-and-moderation.md) §8.11.

## 8. Compatibility

*Sources: [0012](../decisions/0012-api-requirements.md) §1; [0008](../decisions/0008-namespaces-and-document-pages.md) §12; [0025](../decisions/0025-oauth-server.md) §9; [0077](../decisions/0077-special-version.md) §10; [0041](../decisions/0041-content-models.md) §8.*

What MediaWiki and Wikibase clients rely on is specified in [`../api/mediawiki-compat.md`](../api/mediawiki-compat.md) and [`../api/wikibase-compat.md`](../api/wikibase-compat.md), which this chapter does not repeat: the Action API modules and the `continue` protocol, the core and Wikibase REST APIs and their OpenAPI documents, the JSON serialization and the RDF mapping. `mediawiki-compat.md` carries a section on the OAuth 2.0 routes and their MediaWiki paths, noting the 1.0a gap, and attributes each served module to the extension that `siprop=extensions` reports (§2.2); it treats `contentmodel` values as site-specific, which is why `action=paraminfo` enumerates the implemented models. Pywikibot reading and editing `Project` pages is the acceptance test.
